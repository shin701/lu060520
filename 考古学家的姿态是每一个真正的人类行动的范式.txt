 作者同时是预言者和天使。天使是创造。预言者是负责拯救。作者不光创作上作品。她还逆历史而上，将作品放回到救赎的作坊，在作品上打下救赎的烙印。考古学家的姿态是每一个真正的人类行动的范式：
To hark back upwards against the course of history, as the archeologist does, is
then to revert to the work of creation in order to restore it to the salvation from
which it derives. In the same sense, Benjamin made of redemption a fully historical
category, in every sense opposite to the apology that animates the work of bad
historians. Not only is archaeology, in this sense, the immanent a priori of
historiography, but the gesture of the archaeologist is the paradigm of each true
human action. It is not simply the work of life which defines the rank of an author,
and of each man, but the way in which he has succeeded in bringing it back to the
work of redemption, to impress on it the mark of salvation. Only for the one who
will have been able to save it, will creation be possible（阿甘本，《哲学考古学》，2009：228-229）.
