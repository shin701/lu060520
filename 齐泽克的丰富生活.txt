齐泽克的丰富生活
=============================
发布时间：2010-07-30 23:34
 No longer tethered to a single institution, Zizek spends his time roving between speaking engagements at institutions all over the world. He is leaving London first thing tomorrow, he tells me, for Paris to be profiled by the newspaper Libération. Then he is off to headline a Design Congress in Copenhagen (” 7,500,” he shouts to me, still under the photographer's cosh, ”first-class everything, and all that for 40 minutes selling them some old stuff”) and then it is back to Slovenia.
On April 1 this year (”a great day to get married”), he married a 27-year-old Argentinian former lingerie model and now spends one third of his time in Slovenia looking after his young son from a former marriage, a third of his time with his new wife in Buenos Aires, and the rest of his time on the road.
