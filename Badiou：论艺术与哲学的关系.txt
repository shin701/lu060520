Badiou：论艺术与哲学的关系
=============================

 An image comes to mind, an analogous matrix of meaning: philosophy and art are historically coupled the way the Master and the Hysteric coalesce in Lacan. You know how the hysteric confronts the master and says: ”The truth speaks through my tongue, I am 'there,' and you, who knows, do tell me who I am.” And you surmise that whatever wisdom and subtleties lie in the master's reply, the hysteric will let him know it is not as yet that, that her ”there” evades the catch, that all should be resumed, and a lot of effort is required to please her. She thereby takes command over the master and becomes matresse du matre. As it is, art is always already there, addressing the thinker with the silent and scintillating question of its own identity. However, through constant invention - its metamorphosis - art dismisses whatever the philosopher has to say concerning its own self.
