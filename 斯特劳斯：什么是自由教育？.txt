他用了一连串的排比句，来说它；它可以是很多东西，是一连串的用来对付我们时代和人类的堕落的手段。
它是大众文化的解药。它是我们回归民主应该有的样子的途径。它是我们在民主式的群众社会里建立贵族制的一种必要的努力。它是要对群众民主里那些还有耳朵来倾听人类之伟大的人的一种提醒。
Liberal education is the counter-poison to mass culture, to the corroding effects of mass culture, to its inherent tendency to produce nothing but ”specialists without spirit or vision and voluptuaries without heart.” Liberal education is the ladder by which we try to ascend from mass democracy to democracy as originally meant. Liberal education is the necessary endeavor to found an aristocracy within democratic mass society. Liberal education reminds those members of a mass democracy who have ears to hear, of human greatness.
只有在神的国度或社会里才有可能建立民主；除非我们人人都是贵族，我们以为建立和假装在建立的这种大众民主才有机会。自由教育是我们在这种不好的民主里重新生去寻求那种民主本来应该是的样子的一种手段。 
政治哲学、政治科学和政治学只应关注理想的民主与实际的民主之间的不同和差距，这应是其主要的关怀。
”If there were a people consisting of gods, it would rule itself 
democratically. A government of such perfection is not suitable for human beings.” 
This still and small voice has by now become a high-powered loudspeaker. There 
exists a whole science -- the science which I among thousands profess to teach, 
political science -- which so to speak has no other theme than the contrast between 
the original conception of democracy, or what one may call the ideal of democracy, 
and democracy as it is.
