 European Union as we currently know it, that we must fight for what the word  means today. 
它包括我们的启蒙遗产，也包括对于过去的集权主义、种族大屠杀和烈士民主义罪行的意识和搬弄是后悔的接受。欧洲的遗产是无法被替代的，对于世界的未来是至关重要的。我们必须战斗着坚持它。我们不应使欧洲跌落为一种共同市场或共同货币或新民族主义联合体或一种军事力量的地位上。
This includes our Enlightenment heritage, and also an awareness and regretful acceptance of the totalitarian, genocidal and colonialist crimes of the past. ’s heritage is irreplaceable and vital for the future of the world. We must fight to hold on to it. We should not allow  to be reduced to the status of a common market, or a common currency, or a neo-nationalist conglomerate, or a military power. 
我们指望一个这样的欧洲：它的政治构成和政治立场会使它成为反全球化的摇篮，成为反全球化的推动力量，成为变通和替代式观念进入世界舞台的途径，比如说在伊拉克和巴勒斯坦问题上。
A Europe whose constitution and political stance would make it the cradle of counter-globalisation, its driving force, the way alternative ideas reach the world stage, for example in Iraq or Israel-Palestine.
这一欧洲作为过去的启蒙的骄傲产儿和正在到来的新启蒙的先声，会向全世界宣示什么叫做将政治基于比简单的二元对立更老练的东西上。在这一欧洲之中，批判以色列的政策不会被说成是反闪族主义；在这一欧洲中，支持巴勒斯坦人民合法地为他们的权利、土地国家而斗争，并不会被说成是支持自杀爆炸，或与反闪族主义的宣传合污。在这一欧洲中，同时担忧反闪族主义
This , as a proud descendant of the Enlightenment past and a harbinger of the new Enlightenment to come, would show the world what it means to base politics on something more sophisticated than simplistic binary oppositions. In this  it would be possible to criticise Israeli policy, especially that pursued by Ariel Sharon and backed by George Bush, without being accused of anti-semitism. In this Europe, supporting the Palestinians in their legitimate struggle for rights, land and a state would not mean supporting suicide bombing or agreeing with the anti-semitic propaganda that is rehabilitating (with sad success) the outrageous lie that is the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. In this  it would be usual to worry both about rising anti-semitism and rising Islamophobia.  and his policies are not directly responsible for the rise of anti-semitism in .
