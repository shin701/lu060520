The landscape within a crater located at the boundary of the southern highlands and northern lowlands contains much evidence of water, including the ”shoreline” of a hypothesized ancient ocean. It also contains deposits of sediment left by flowing water and the crater is cut by gullies.[我是一个图片]
Sometimes, the orbiter looked into space, too. It took this picture of Phobos, the larger of Mars's two moons, from a distance of only 4,200 miles. In the lower right is Stickney, a crater 5.5 miles wide that is the largest feature on the moon.

On Mars, there is more than one type of ice; in addition to frozen water, there's also dry ice -- frozen carbon dioxide -- which shapes and reshapes the Martian landscape. From left: blocks of icy debris, warmed by the sun, tumble down cliffs of the northern ice cap; swirling dust devils leave tracks on defrosting dune surfaces in the south; as polar ice recedes, the surface erodes in scalloped ridges; during spring in the north, sand dunes emerge from the blanket of frost; starburst patterns are created as ice warms into gas and expands, creating channels spreading out radially; when the gas breaks through the ice, it creates plumes and material is carried downwind.
