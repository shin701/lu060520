跑步的快乐
=============================

 Ever since then — two years ago in May — running has been solely and only a fun thing in my life. Just bolting out of the door and running away from things is such an exciting thing to do, that I can feel my heart-rate increasing, just thinking about it. I slam the front-door going, “HAR HAR — YOU’LL NEVER CATCH ME, COPPER!” to a battalion of imaginary, pursuing policemen, and I peg it.I love how sleek and extreme it is — in terms of simplicity and time efficiency, running is the Martini of exercise. If you want to, you can push yourself with it to such an extent that — up hill, in rain, wind peeling your eyeballs — you feel like you’re punching into the face of God.
On other days, there’s such fun in it, it’s like throwing an incongruous one-woman party at 9am, on a pavement. Especially when you find the right music. I went running in the first snowfall to Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush, and OH MY GOD. It turns out a mad wig-haired woman in a nightie knocks spots off the theme-tune to Rocky, as motivational music goes. Aside from shaving four minutes off my usual time, I also discovered that you really can incorporate wheeling arm-movements and a couple of pliés into a 400-yard final sprint. The people on the W5 bus at the junction of Ridge Road and Mayfield Road loved it. They could see that, really, running is just like dancing, but in a straight line.
Well, I say that. But that is still, to be fair, just in my head. In reality, I look — as I did two years ago — very much like a Womble being chased off someone’s front lawn while looking for buns. But with a slightly smaller arse than before.
