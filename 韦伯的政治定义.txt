韦伯的"政治"定义
=============================

 奋斗着去分享权力,或努力去影响权力分配,不是在国空之间,就是在群体之间.'politics' for us means striving to share power or striving to influence the distribution of power, either among states or among groups within a state.
活跃于政治中的人,要么是将权力作为其它目的\理想或自我目标的手段来追求,,要么就是为了权力本身,也主浊说,是为了享受权力所给予的那种高人一等的感觉.
He who is active in politics strives for power either as a means in serving other aims, ideal or egoistic, or as 'power for power's sake,' that is, in order to enjoy the prestige-feeling that power gives. 
现代领袖则更多在依赖于个人魅力,带动其信众,来实现主导,因此才有以政治为职业之说:
domination by virtue of the devotion of those who obey the purely personal 'charisma' of the 'leader.'
领袖个人被看作是内在地被内在地召唤出来的人,是被领导者心目中的人,是他们要他成为的那种人:the leader is personally recognized as the innerly 'called' leader of men. 
从草根冒出来的政治领袖是demogogue,信从他的人通过他来剥削被主导者:for the demagogue's following, there are 'spoils'--that is, exploitation of the dominated through the monopolization of office--and there are politically determined profits and premiums of vanity.
