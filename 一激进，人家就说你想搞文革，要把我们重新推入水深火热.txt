 如果不责疑自由民主的后意识形态共识，就没有思想自由：“Fidelity to the democratic consensus” means
the acceptance of the present liberal-parliamentary consensus,
which precludes any serious questioning of how this liberaldemocratic
order is complicit in the phenomena it officially
condemns, and, of course, any serious attempt to imagine a
society whose socio-political order would be different. In short,
it means: say and write whatever you want — on condition that
what you do, does not effectively question or disturb the
predominant political consensus. So everything is allowed,
solicited even, as a critical topic: the prospects of a global
ecological catastrophe, violations of human rights, sexism,
homophobia, antifeminism, the growing violence not only in the
far-away countries, but also in our megalopolises, the gap
3
between the First and the Third World, between the rich and the
poor, the shattering impact of the digitalization of our daily
lives... there is nothing easier today than to get international,
state or corporate funds for a multidisciplinary research into
how to fight the new forms of ethnic, religious or sexist
violence. The problem is that all this occurs against the
background of a fundamental Denkverbot, the prohibition to
think. Today’s liberal-democratic hegemony is sustained by a
kind of unwritten Denkverbot similar to the infamous
Berufsverbot in Germany of the late 60s — the moment one
shows a minimal sign of engaging in political projects that aim
to seriously challenge the existing order, the answer is
immediately: “Benevolent as it is, this will necessarily end in a
new Gulag!” The ideological function of the constant reference
to the holocaust, gulag and the more recent Third World
catastrophes is thus to serve as the support of this Denkverbot
by constantly reminding us how things may have been much
worse: “Just look around and see for yourself what will happen
if we follow your radical notions!” And it is exactly the same
thing that the demand for “scientific objectivity” means: the
moment one seriously questions the existing liberal consensus,
one is accused of abandoning scientific objectivity for the
outdated ideological positions. This is the point on which one
cannot and should not concede: today, the actual freedom of
thought means the freedom to question the predominant liberaldemocratic
“post-ideological” consensus — or it means nothing（齐泽克《重复列宁》）.
