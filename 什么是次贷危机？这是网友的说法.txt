 The papers chunter about this weird beastie called the 'credit crunch', as if it is a force of nature. It is not - it is the cumulative force of all of us, each of our desires to have something we can not afford now, our desire to grow rich on the proceeds of doing no work, our greed and stupidity.
一种由我们身上累积起来的力量，是因为我们每一个人都想得到我们买不起的东西，是我们想不劳而获的欲望，我们的贪婪和愚蠢结集而成的力量：the cumulative force of all of us, each of our desires to have something we can not afford now, our desire to grow rich on the proceeds of doing no work, our greed and stupidity.
但这种力量将把我们带到哪里？难道也是一种改正和拯救的力量？大难中有大拯救？
