 Strictly speaking, dissensus means a conflict between one sensible order and
another. There is dissensus when there is something wrong in the picture, when
something is not at the right place. There is dissensus when we don’t know how to
designate what we see, when a name no longer suits the thing or the character that it
names, etc. A dissensus is thus an aesthetic matter. It is a matter of poetic invention.
But poetic invention does not mean the invention of an imaginary place, a place that is
elsewhere or nowhere. It means a displacement or a break in a given set of places and
identities. In other words, it is a political matter. There is a poetics of politics which
consists in inventing cases of dissensus（《做一个非澳大利亚人意味什么？》）.
