 大多数情况总是，问题最坏，政府一干预就弄得它更坏十倍：There are few problems so bad that a government cannot make them ten times worse by intervening. The housing market is no exception. Much as it will cause pain to those who bought too late into the dream of home ownership, the only sensible policy is to stand back and let the market find its own level.

网友跟贴的水平也不懒：
----The sheer unanimity of the comments in this section confims just how spot on Ross Clark's assessment is. Though market forces sometimes bear undesirable social consequences, in this instance a sharp market correction could save millions from decades of ruinous interest payments - butt out Gordon!!----Karl, Heswall, Wirral
----Grabbing free money by artificially pushing up the price of housing has obviously fallen flat on it's greedy face. Let the prices fall until that practice is no longer exploitable. Houses should be for living in not for speculating on. The old thieving ways and days are over as hard reality sets in.----Colin, -rmarthen
----property is mostly purchased through debt - the so called 'effortless wealth creation' was merely wealth transfer from those buying houses to those who already owned them. That isn't wealth creation it's redistribution : housing creates little in terms of true wealth for the nation as a whole。----j dickinson, middlesborough
