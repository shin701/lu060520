 On May 11 2010, the executives of the three companies involved in the Gulf oil disaster — BP, Transocean and Halliburton — who testified before the US Senate got involved in a ridiculous game of blaming each other worthy of a Magritte painting: BP claimed it is not responsible since the rig that exploded is owned by Transocean, its subcontractor;  Transocean claimed the work done by its own subcontractor Halliburton who poured the concrete is responsible, and, finally, Halliburton claimed it just executed the project proposed to them by BP… What makes the scene ridiculous is not only the undignified game of blaming each other, but, even more, the idea that looking for the culprits (big companies) and making them pay the full price for the damage they’ve caused — unfortunately, it was President Obama whose condemnation of the ridiculous spectacle of the three companies was ridiculous in its own way. What is ridiculously-nave is the idea that a private company, no matter how rich, can pay for the entire damage of a serious ecological catastrophy. If the worst that we fear will happen and the spilling will go on for a long time, then the damage to the environment and to the millions of people living (not only) there is simply irreparable — it would be like demanding from the Nazis that they cover the full price of the holocaust.
The lesson is simply that, while market mechanisms may work up to a certain level to contain ecological damage, serious large-scale ecological catastrophies are simply out of their reach — any pseudo-scientific statistic talk about “sustainable risks” is ridiculous here. More than two decades ago, a paparazzo caught Senator Ted Kennedy (well known for his opposition to the off-shore drilling in search of oil) in the midst of the sexual act on a lone boat off Louisiana shore; during a Senate debate a couple of days later, a Republican Senator dryly remarked: “It seems that Senator Kennedy now changed his position on off-shore drilling…” So maybe, we should return to Senator Kennedy’s position: the only acceptable off-shore drilling is the one he was engaged in.
