 图像是有版权的吗？作者是如何将他的个人印记打到图像上的？作者的灵魂是如何穿过相机这个装置而成为作品的主权者的？摄影师盗取（也许可以说得好听点是“借”）了被摄取者的身影，而别人来使用这个图像就算违法，这种版权法是不是将艺术家的盗当了借，将观众台的借又当了盗呢？
In order for copyright law to be able to accept the claims of the photographer as a co-equal author, it becomes important to resurrect the creative subject who had disappeared into the machine. A soul has to be found in a mechanical act, the soulless labor of operating a camera. But this soul or personality cannot flow through the apparatus, and so the apparatus must be circumventedotherwise authorial credit would be void. Creative genius therefore must navigate its way through the apparatus and make its mark without actually touching the apparatus. It therefore must provide a mere imprint of personalityand this is never really found in the work but present everywhere elsein choice, technique, artistic practice, etcetera.
The result of this creative subject's interaction with the mechanical device is a wholly new object, one which is now protected by copyright law. It is protectable because the new technology has been given an ”imprint of personality,” and is converted into an act marked by the sign of the author. Thus, the initial surprise felt by the law in its encounter with technology is now rendered familiar and understandable. So ”new technologies may 'surprise' old categories, but only to be reformed according to existing conceptions of the world. Science and engineering may produce technologies that outstrip human capabilities, but these strange inventions are soon reconceiveddomesticated and humanizedas they the are put to use.”[4]
However, even after copyright demanded that of the soul of the author be infused into photography for it to be protectable, subsequent developments in copyright have shown scant regard for the soul of the photographer and have focused instead on the exchange value of the photograph-as-commodity. Joi Ito's photographic contributions will significantly aid our understanding of the anti-image politics of copyright, and to enable a greater reflection on the future of the image as being one in which the image is free as in soul.
