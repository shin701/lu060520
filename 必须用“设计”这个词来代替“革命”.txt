必须用“设计”这个词来代替“革命”

how to draw things together, that is, to design. 
What no 
revolution has ever contemplated, namely the remaking of our collective life on 
earth, is to be carried through with exactly the opposite of revolutionary and 
modernizing attitudes. This is what renders the spirit of the time so interesting. 
President Mao was right after all: the revolution has to always be revolutionized. 
What he did not anticipate is that the new °∞revolutionary°energy would be taken 
from the set of attitudes that are hard to come by in revolutionary movements: 
modesty, care, precautions, skills, crafts, meanings, attention to details, careful 
conservations, redesign, artificiality, and ever shifting transitory fashions. We have 
to be radically careful, or carefully radical° What an odd time we are living 
through. 
°∞Dasein ist design°
There is no outside: outside is another 
inside with another climate control, another thermostat, another air conditioning 
system. Are you in public? Public spaces are spaces too, for goodness sake. They 
are not different in that respect from private spaces. They are simply organized 
differently, with different architectures, different entry points, different surveillance 
systems, different soundscapes. To try to philosophize about what it is to be 
°∞thrown ito the world°± without defining more precisely, more literally (Sloterdijk
is first of all a literalist in his use of metaphors) the sort of envelopes into which 
humans are thrown, would be like trying to kick a cosmonaut into outer space 
without a spacesuit. Naked humans are as rare as naked cosmonauts. To define 
humans is to define the envelopes, the life support systems, the Umwelt that make it 
possible for them to breathe. This is exactly what humanism has always missed. 
(This is why Habermas became so cross at Sloterdijk and launched a very mean 
attack against him: naked humans on the one hand, fully equipped humans on life 
support on the other (R) of course there was no way for those two German thinkers 
to agree with one another). 
Critique, deconstruction and iconoclasm, once again, will simply not do the job of 
finding an alternative design. What is needed instead are tools that capture what 
have always been the hidden practices of modernist innovations: objects have 
always been projects; matters of fact have always been matters of concern. The 
tools we need to grasp these hidden practices will teach us just as much as the old 
aesthetics of matters of fact °and then again much more. Let me be clear (R) I am 
not advocating for another CAD design for Prometheus What I am pressing for is 
a means for drawing things together °gods, non humans and mortals included. 
Why should this prove to be an impossible task? Why can the powerful visual 
vocabulary that has been devised in the past by generations of artists, engineers, 
designers, philosophers, artisans and activists for matters of fact, not be devised (I 
hesitate to say restyled) for matters of concern?
