齐泽克：虚拟空间里我们反而更不自由、更有罪感了

 The suspension of the Master, which reveals impotence, in no way gives rise
to liberating effects: the knowledge that 'the Other doesn't exist' (that the Master
is impotent, that Power is an imposture) imposes on the subject an even more
radical servitude than the traditional subordination to the full authority of the
Master. In his analysis of Paul Claudel's Coufontaine trilogy, Lacan elaborates
the distinction between classical and modern tragedy: classical tragedy is the
tragedy of Destiny, of the subject guilty without his active participation; guilt is
inscribed into his very position in the symbolic network of Destiny. The modern,
postChristian tragedy, on the contrary, takes place in a universe in which 'God is
dead' - that is, our lives are no longer preordained by the cosmic frame of
Destiny. Lacan's point here is that this absence of Destiny, of the symbolic frame
which deten-nines our guilt in advance, not only does not make us free, but
imposes on us an even more radical tragic guilt - as he puts it, the subject's tragic
fate hinges on the fact that he becomes the hostage of the Word.35
The supreme example of this new tragic predicament is the fate of the
sacrificed Stalinist Communist: this example makes it clear how - to put it
succinctly - the subject is called upon to sacrifice himself in order to save the
appearance (of the Master's or Leader's omnipotence and knowledge) - to
prevent the Master's impotence from becoming visible to all the world. When, in
the post-classical universe, no one 'really believes' in the universal Destiny
inherent in the cosmic Order (be it Christian Faith or Communism) - when, to
put it in Hegelese, Faith loses its substantial weight - it becomes crucial to
maintain the appearance of Faith. When a true believer in Stalinist Communism
is asked to confess his deviancy, or even his treason, the underlying line of
argumentation is: 'We all know that the big Other doesn't exist (that our Leader
is not perfect, that we
159
have made a lot of mistakes, that there are no iron laws of History, that the
Necessity of Progress towards Communism is not as inexorable as we pretend),
but to acknowledge this would add up to a total catastrophe. The only way to
save the appearance - to safeguard the Party and its Leader as historical Reason
incarnate, to avoid imputing to the Leader and the Party the responsibility for our
evident failures - is for you to assume the responsibility for our failures - that is
to say, to confess your guilt.' This underlying logic of the Stalinist show trials
thus bears direct witness to the fact that Communism is no longer a substantial
Faith, but a modern Faith relying on the subject's readiness to sacrifice himself
and to assume guilt in order to keep hidden the fact that 'the father is humiliated',
that the Leader is impotent. The subject is not called upon to sacrifice himself
for the Truth of the Faith: he is called upon to sacrifice himself precisely so that
the fact that 'the big Other doesn't exist' will continue to be invisible, so that the
idealized figure of the Leader embodying the big Other will remain intact and
unblemished.
In this sense, the subject is 'the hostage of the Word': 'Word' stands here for the
ideological doctrine which has lost its substantial bearings, it has the status of a
pure semblance, but which - precisely as such, as a pure semblance - is essential.
The subject is blackmailed and, as it were, cornered by being told that if he
doesn't forget about his individual rights, his innocence, or even his honor and
dignity, and confess, the -Word which guarantees the semblance of Meaning will
disintegrate. In other words, he is asked to sacrifice himself, the innermost kernel
of his being - not for the True Cause, but for a pure semblance. Furthermore, this
retreat of substantial Destiny, of the symbolic Law regulating our existence, also
coincides with the shift from symbolic Law to superego: the agent who imposes
on the subject the sacrifice which should 'save the appearance' (say, the
confession at the show trial 'needed by the Party to forge its unity and mobilize
its members') is clearly a superego figure amassing the jouissance of which the
subject is deprived: the appearance of Destiny to which this subject refers (in the
case of Stalinism, as the 'inexorable progress towards Communism') is a mask
concealing the jouissance of the subject who reserves for himself the position of
the object-instrument of the big Other （《虚拟空间》，33-34）.3
