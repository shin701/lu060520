诗与哲学，批评与策展者的关系
=============================

 Holderlin describes philosophy (in a letter
to Neuffer) as a ”hospital in which the unfortunate poet can take
refuge with honor.”5 In our day the hospital of philosophy has
closed its shutters. Critics, transformed into curators,” heedlessly
take the place of artists in order to simulate the work of creation
that the latter have abandoned, while artisans, who have become
inoperative, dedicate themselves with great zeal to a work of redemption
in which there is no longer any work to save. In both
cases creation and salvation no longer scratch onto one another
the signature of their tenacious, amorous conflict. Unsigned and
divided, they place each other in front of a mirror in which they
cannot recognize themselves（《裸》，6-7）.
