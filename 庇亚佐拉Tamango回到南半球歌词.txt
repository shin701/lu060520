 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbFdngoPHPEmode=relatedsearch=( I am ) returning to the south
like one always falls in love again 
I come back to you, 
full of desires, full of fears
I feels the south, 
it is the yearned destiny of my heart
I am from the south, 
like the air that gives life to the bandoneon
I dream of the south, 
its immense moon, its sky upside down
I love the south, 
its good people, its dignity
I feel the south, 
like I feel your body when we are been intimate
I love you south, 
I love you ---Second Half---
( I am ) returning to the south,
as one always falls in love again
I come back to you, 
full of desires and fears
I love the south, 
its good people, its it dignity
I fell the south,
like I feel your body when we are been intimate
I carry the south ( within )
I dream of the south
I am returning to the south http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbFdngoPHPEmode=relatedsearch=
