消费社会里的英雄主义

 切尔西主帅的相貌,成为报纸女专栏作家歌哭的理由.浑身投入超市的闹市车流,但仍想被英雄面相的明星包围,穆里尼奥的脸,安杰利那朱丽的身局,斯歌丽强生的唇,一方面,我们的审美主体自我切分,分别认同到了一些美丽器官和身体比例参数上,另一方面,我们将所有的道德难度切割到一些微小的选项上,去成为,只是打钩和认同的事儿了.
Jose Mourinho's departure deprives women of an achingly chic heartthrob(一个令人心动得很痛的帅哥哥) 
Without the teeniest possibility that I'll catch a glimpse of him - in the terraces, on the bench, jumping up and down on the sidelines in a killer coat(他总穿着杀手的黑外套在边线上窜动!)
My passion for Mourinho is multi-layered and nuanced.我对他的冲动是多层的,细微无穷的!
salt 'n' peppery, darkly brooding, sardonically eyebrowed dream of a man, to be specific.这男人是咸咸的,阴沉地迷思着的,诡异地不醒的梦般的.
Mourinho is intriguing because he's an arrogant, charming, delicious, excitable soap opera in human form. He is the antithesis of the ineloquent, cliche-spouting, hedge-straddling vortices of characters that otherwise populate the Premier League and its related factions.
The puffing out of the cheeks, the dismissive frowns(无奈但反正随它去一一皱眉), the sullen jaw-clenching(阴沉的一咬牙), the moody scowl, the wry smiles(别扭的微笑) ... Even more brilliant!
他自成一种时尚:Mourinho knows his suits and his polo shirts, his brogues and his belts. He knows how high to button his shirts and when to wear a crew-neck T-shirt beneath them; he knows how fat to knot his ties, at precisely what angle to swish his scarves. He knows how close to crop his hair and how far he can allow it to grow out. He knows which colours work best against his skin tones.
外套是他的声明:he knows the power of a statement coat. Never mind the trophies or the multiple league wins - Mourinho's greatest achievement in my book was to take a single-breasted grey cashmere Armani overcoat and turn it into a signature piece. Thus, he introduced the men of Britain to the potential of a cult item and single-handedly raised the bar on our collective aesthetic.
应将我身上的那个另一半他者,转变成穆里尼奥:transforming the significant male other in your life into a Mourinho-alike.
甚至为他的时尚风险捏一把汗:I had a tough time over his American Express advert, which was almost funny ... but then wasn't. And I don't like it when he gets 'papped' wearing a tracksuit around town. At training, it's acceptable.
Brooding, honed and typically solitary,” one panted. “Beauty, charm, glamour and decency,” gasped another – that last adjective presumably occasioned by the fact that Jose was very nice to his pet dog, Leya. Elsewhere he was compared to Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. He was a “naked sexual challenge”, too, apparently
Suave, raffish, handsome and nicely turned out, Mourinho was Portugal’s gift to the women of Britain, apparently. 
he talked, with that wry, cute, curl of the lip, about how you need class A eggs to make a good omelette and that it was best if the eggs were purchased at Waitrose. 
战场上的英雄需要凶恶的敌人,消费社会里,一个人的性感,就是对我的挑战!

好解构:他接替年老的福格森,到曼联去教练;为了全体英国女人,应请他当英格兰队主教练.联赛真是媒体社会和系统社会的好写照:
