德里达：什么是新国际？

 我相信一种经常是沉默的、但正越来越有效的全球 团结。这不再应被定义为国际社会主义者组织，但我想保留英特耐雄尔这一名称，以让人回想到那种革命精神和正义，后者应当仍能够团结劳动阶级和被压迫阶级。这种新国际不承认自己是处于仍被某些国家权力主导的国家和国际机构。它更接近于非政府组织，某些人道 主义计划，但它也超越它们，它呼吁深刻改变国际法及其执行程序。这一新国际在今天是这样一种角色：成为我在《马克思的种种幽灵》里列举的全球 秩序之十大瘟疫的受难者和同情者。它展示了在官司方的政治修辞和“介入的知识分子”们的话语，甚至在公开宣称的人权斗士中间极少被说到的那些方面。I believe in an often silent, but more and more effective global solidarity. It is no longer defined as an organisation of International Socialists (but I keep the old name of an 'International' to recall something of the spirit of revolution and of justice which ought to reunite the workers and the oppressed beyond national frontiers). It does not recognise itself in the states or the international agencies that are dominated by certain stately powers. It is closer to non-governmental organisations, certain humanitarian projects, but it transgresses them as well and appeals to a profound change in international law and its setting to work. This International has today the figure of suffering and of compassion for the ten plagues of global order I enumerate in Specters of Marx. It decries that of which one speaks so little in the official political rhetoric and in the discourse of 'engaged intellectuals', even among the declared champions of human rights. To give some examples of easily distracting macro-statistics, I think of the millions of children who drown every year, of the nearly 50 per cent of women who are beaten or fall victim to sometimes murderous abuse (the 60 million disappeared women, the 30 million mutilated women), of the 23 million infected with AIDS (of which 90 per cent are in Africa and to whom the budget of AIDS research dedicates only 5 per cent of its resources, while therapy remains unavailable outside small occidental milieus), I think of the selective infanticide of girls in India and of the monstrous conditions of child labour in many countries, and of the fact that there are, I believe, a billion illiterate people and 140 million uneducated children, I think of the maintenance of the death penalty and of the circumstances of its administration in the United States (the only Western democracy to do so and a country that no longer recognises the convention concerning children’s rights and continues to execute punishment against minors even after they have reached adult age, etc.). I quote these numbers, published in official reports, from memory in order to convey an idea of the scale of the problems that call for an 'international' solidarity of which no state, no party, no syndicate, no civic organisation really takes charge. All who suffer and all those who are not insensitive to the dimension of these urgent issues belong to this International, everybody who - civic or national background notwithstanding - is determined to draw the attention of politics, law and ethics towards them.
