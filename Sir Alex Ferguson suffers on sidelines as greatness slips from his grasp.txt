 Simon Barnes Now we know. Now we know why Sir Alex Ferguson hasn’t given himself up to the life of a living national treasure, wine-bore, film-bore and racing wannabe. Now we know why he hasn’t gone for the ambassadorial sinecure, smugly undermining his successor while flying first-class to unimportant meetings. Now we know why the grandchildren and Lady Ferguson have been waiting so long for his exclusive attention.
It was to take his rightful place. His place as the greatest club football manager that ever drew breath. So that people will be able to say this thing without a trace of argument, without a scintilla of irony: Ferguson really was the best, you know.
The best ever. And those with other favourites, with alternative candidates, will have to say: You’re right. It’s beyond contention. It’s a fine, noble aim, and it has taken Manchester United to great things, but it also took them last night to despair.
   As the events unfolded in the Champions League final between United and Barcelona, the matter of Ferguson’s true stature in the game was still in doubt as the final whistle blew. Barcelona’s ultimately straightforward victory means that any idea Ferguson has of greatness beyond all others must be put on hold. That will irk him.
Ferguson will never match Paisley on two fronts. First, two very fortunate wins in his much longer tenure, with huge resources doesn't even come close in EU. Domestically, Paisley's % says it all. More telling, the character of the man. Paisley? A true gentleman.Ferguson? Not fit to lace his boots.
