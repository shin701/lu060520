 德勒兹生前最后二年里曾与巴迪厄广泛通信，后者对他的思想有很发展式的了解：
Deleuze, curious about every aspect of his time and adjusting
both his thought to the capture of the shimmering surface of an event's occurrence
and his magical writing to the traversing of meaning's disparate zones, is considered,
in echo of the virtue that he conceded to be Leibniz's in the classical age, as
the inventor of a contemporary Baroque, in which our desire for the multiple, intermixtures,
and the coexistence of universes free of any common rule -in sum,
our planetary democratism -is able to recognize itself and unfurl. In short, we end
up with Deleuze as the joyous thinker of the world's confusion（《德勒兹》，10）.
