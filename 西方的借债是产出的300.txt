 If you combine consumer, corporate and public sector debt, the ratio of our borrowings to our annual economic output is a bit over 300 per cent, or more than ￡4,000 billion. Over the past decade, we borrowed and we borrowed and we borrowed: we assumed that the day when we had to pay it back would never arrive.One of the best ways of understanding how all our debts were accumulated is to look at the gross foreign current liabilities of our banks. These rose from ￡1,100 billion in 1997 to ￡4,400 billion this year - again, about three times the size of our annual economic output.
This trend tells two stories. It shows the massive and unsustainable growth in the City of London and our financial services industry - which is now shrinking with a vengeance, at the cost of massive job losses and evaporating tax revenues (perhaps ￡30 billion to ￡40 billion of income for the Exchequer gone for ever). But it also shows that our debts are, to a large extent, the recycled savings of other countries, notably the massive surpluses of China, other Asian economies and the Middle East.
To put it in crude terms, for much of the past decade, millions of Chinese slaved away on near-subsistence wages and still managed to save, both as a nation (China swanks ￡1,400 billion in foreign exchange reserves) and as individuals. This imbalance - between savings in the East and our indebtedness in the West, between their massive trade surpluses and our deficits - was never sustainable.
For me, the most important event of the past week was the chastising of the US Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson, by Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the Chinese central bank. Mr Zhou said that “overconsumption and a high reliance on credit is the cause of the US financial crisis” and “the US should take the initiative to adjust its policies, raise its savings ratio appropriately and reduce its trade and fiscal deficits”.
