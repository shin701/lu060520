 In the '60s, Regis Debray fought beside Che Guevara in Bolivia. Today, his obsession isn't
ideology- it's ”mediology.”

Political dominance always means that you kill off other ways of seeing things. By
transforming three-quarters of the world into a cultural proletariat, you will make people of
this class into more determined rebels in the 21st century. Far more determined, in fact, than
the economic proletariat has been in the 20th century.
The machine offered Descartes a model for thinking about the human body. It later provided
British mathematician Alan Turing with a model for intelligent behavior. But machines will
never be able to give the thinking process a model of thought itself, since machines are not
mortal. What gives humans access to the symbolic domain of value and meaning is the fact
that we die.
What I call the jogging effect. When the automobile was industrialized, futurologists said
that people would develop atrophied legs from sitting cramped in their cars all day. What
happened was commuters put on Lycra shorts and started running on their lunch breaks.
Each technical step forward means a compensating step backward in our mind-sets. Islamic
fundamentalists don't come from the traditional universities deeply rooted in a literary
educational system; they graduate from engineering schools and technical colleges. Last
century, some futurologists foresaw the end of national wars under the influence of
spreading railroad lines and electrical telegraphy; others believed that industrialization
would wipe out religious superstition.
In fact, an imbalance in technologies tends to provoke a corresponding refocusing on ethnic
values.
