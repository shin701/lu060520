谈论危机时所用的修辞
=============================

 China is far too poor, too technologically backward and too inward-looking to be a credible economic leader and its social arrangements are hardly a model for the democratic world. As for Europe, it would suffer even more institutional damage than the US from a prolonged depression, as it did in the 1930s. In short, the widely predicted depression would lead to what some investors describe as the Mad Max world: a state of global anarchy in which the only assets worth owning would be farmland and oil wells - and the guns and ammunition to protect them.
The alternative possibility is that monetary and fiscal stimulus succeed and the world returns to normal growth and moderate unemployment within a year or so. To judge by much commentary, this benign outcome is unlikely. But on Wall Street and in much of Asia it is becoming the mainstream assumption.
In my view, the benign scenario should be the focus of all policy discussions for two reasons. First, because economic theory tells us that fiscal and monetary reflation will succeed and hints of success are starting to show. The second reason is an economic equivalent of Pascal's Wager: if the world is about to collapse into anarchy and nothing can be done, there is no benefit in predicting it. If, on the other hand, the end of the world can be averted, acting on this assumption, will make recovery more likely. But even on this benign assumption, some big upheavals may lie ahead.
