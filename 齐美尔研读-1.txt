 在都市生活中,人的心理会面临非常震惊的感性印象,为了使自己的psyche不受到挫折,人用头脑而不是用心去感受事物.也就是,人用了精神中的较高的更容易调整的那一部分,来应付现实.这最后发展成为一种器官,来保护他.在都市式的事件发展节律里,智性这个最不敏感最远离人的个性之深底的感官,成为生活的导航工具.智性第一,这是都市生活里我们用来保全主观生活不被压倒一切的都市生活节律操纵的一个不是办法的办法.
用智性来思考,用理论态度来对人和事儿,对什么都无可无不可,这种blasé 的态度,也是理论知识分子作为都市群体的对自己的研究对象的态度.
用理论来研究是对我们的精神和心理的保护?
理论上的把握,实际是人的想远离研究对象的对现实的态度?
反过来说,因为对现实就事论事,我们的心理和精神会吃不消,所以,我们减负,用理论去对付现实?
＜都市和精神生活0＞:
The intellect {6}, however, has its locus in the transparent, conscious, higher layers of the psyche; it is the most adaptable of our inner forces. In order to accommodate to change and to the contrast of phenomena, the intellect does not require any shocks and inner upheavals; it is only through such upheavals that the more conservative mind could accommodate to the metropolitan rhythm of events. Thus the metropolitan type of man-which, of course, exists in a thousand individual variants - develops an organ protecting him against the threatening currents and discrepancies of his external environment which would uproot him. He reacts with his head instead of his heart. In this an increased awareness assumes the psychic prerogative. Metropolitan life, thus, underlies a heightened awareness and a predominance of intelligence in metropolitan man. The reaction to metropolitan phenomena is shifted to that organ which is least sensitive and quite remote from the depth of the personality. Intellectuality is thus seen to preserve subjective life against the overwhelming power of metropolitan life, and intellectuality branches out in many directions and is integrated with numerous discrete phenomena.
