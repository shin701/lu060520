朗西埃与巴迪厄的区别
=============================

 As to Badiou, there are doubtless certain
similarities: a shared fidelity to a common
history, a similar way of thinking politics by
separating it from state practice, the question of
power, and the tradition of political philosophy.
But there is also in Badiou this affirmative
posture oriented towards eternity which I
absolutely cannot identify with. His idea of
absolute disconnection or unrelation, his idea of
an event that stands out sharply against the situation,
his idea of the quasi-miraculous force of
the evental statement5 – these are ideas I
absolutely cannot share（2002年8月29日访谈）.
