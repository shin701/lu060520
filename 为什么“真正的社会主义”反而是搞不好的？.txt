为什么“真正的社会主义”反而是搞不好的？

 Consider the fashionable argument according to which
Real Socialism failed because it endeavored to impose onto
reality an illusory utopian vision of humanity, not taking into
account the way real people are structured through the force
of tradition: on the contrary, Real Socialism failed because it
was — in its Stalinist version — ALL TOO “REALISTIC,” because
it underestimated the REAL of the “illusions” which continued
to determine human activity (“bourgeois individualism,”
etc.), and conceived of the “construction of socialism”
as a ruthlessly “realistic” mobilization and exploitation of
individuals in order to build a new order. One is thus tempted
to claim that, while Lenin still remained faithful to the “real
of the (Communist) illusion,” to its emancipatory utopian
potential, Stalin was a simple “realist,” engaged in a ruthless
power-struggle（《论信仰》，82）.
