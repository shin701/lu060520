 英国媒体里有人这样评论中国的那版开闭幕式：All just a bit too loud, just a bit too boastful。
又有人说，英国人的8分钟所要的效果是：Jokes. Irony. Self-mockery，而这中国人办大型运动会时最缺少的。
但其实所有的什么式，都是这样的：These gargantuan, megalomaniacal opening and closing ceremonies don't matter in sporting or in any other terms. They are just a projection of image, and are invariably too long, too dull and far, far too loud. Would it were that all opening and closing ceremonies lasted eight minutes.
