 Spiegel: According to a recent poll by the Bertelsmann foundation, only 31 percent of Germans have a good opinion of the social market economy. 
Beck: Politicians and managers are no longer regarded as risk managers but as risk creators. Even Hartz reforms [radical German welfare system that combined income support and unemployment benefits and reduced duration of benefits] have also reduced trust in the social security offered by the state. Politics shifts life risks one-sidedly on the individual and rids itself of its obligation for social security and welfare. 
Spiegel: Will the old idea of equality have a greater meaning in the future? 
Beck: A greater relative equality in any case. Instead of socializing losses and individualizing profits, banks managers and boards of directors should be liable for their losses and mistakes. Equality will also play a more important role internationally. Up-and-coming threshold countries like Brazil, India and China demand and receive more rights to join in the conversation.
