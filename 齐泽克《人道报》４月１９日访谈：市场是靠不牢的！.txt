 HUMA: Global capitalism, you suggest, tries to transcend the current phase of its contradictions by mutating into “green capitalism”. Is the capitalist system compatible with ecology?
ZIZEK: Let us compare the reactions of the world’s great powers in the face of the financial crisis, to their attitude at the conference in Copenhagen. Confronted with the financial crisis, they decreed it was a case of the utmost urgency. In one week colossal sums of money were mobilized. When the survival of capitalism, of the banking sector, is at stake, action can be taken in no time. But when our survival as a species is jeopardized, what is their reaction? A compromise that is not even binding, a declaration of intent. That, clearly, is the logic of capitalism.
What eggs us on on the road to ecology is simply an enlightened utilitarianism, the need to take action to ensure our survival. Capitalism on the contrary follows its own logic, even if in the long term this logic represents a threat to our very material interests. I do not exclude the possibility that ecology might turn into the next opium for the people. Yes, we are confronted with absolute threats. But these threats are invoked to justify a mobilization of all the reactionary, regressive ideologies that put the ecological crisis down to technological reason per se. One of ecology’s great dangers is to propose a paradigm of nature as a mother-figure. A homeostatic version of nature. I believe that the environment and our natural resources are rather to be ranked among our “commons” in the Marxian sense of the word.
That is why I insist on the necessary reference to communism. In the face of the radical catastrophes that are looming ahead, no solution is to be expected from the market. Hence the necessity to develop two aspects of communism jointly. First the fight for the commons, for what must be shared, is of primordial importance. Secondly, neither the market nor the State can offer a way out.
