Bruno Latour:使政治公共
=============================

 No media, no court of appeals, no governing institution, and yet many more
controversies for which ”precedents are lacking, where novelty and confusion
pervade everything”: Yes, the situation is much worse now than before. This is
why, as John Dewey argued in The Public and Its Problems (1927), in response to
Lippmann's indictment of naive democratic ideals, completely new definitions of
art, science, and politics are needed.
The first task is to make possible the representation-in all the meanings of the
word-of the issues to be tackled. As the philosopher Noortje Marres has said: ”No
issue, no politics.” And to render the issues visible to the nascent public, not only
the resources of the social and natural sciences but those of art are demanded.
Without the diverse cooperation of artists, activists, and social and natural
scientists, as Dewey argued, it is impossible to explore and retrace the unwanted
consequences of our collective actions-and, most of all, to restore confidence in

scientific institutions by making their work and, yes, their controversies fully
visible. This is what Peter Weibel and I attempted to simulate in the exhibition
”Making Things Public” at ZKM in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2005: how to forge
new techniques of representation, to add ”art forums” and ”science agoras” to the
arenas of conventional politics.
As Dewey wrote so dramatically: ”Since conditions of action and of inquiry and
knowledge are always changing, the experiment must always be retried; the State
must always be rediscovered.”3 Such is the aim of what could be called ”political
arts”-and this, then, is the field of exploration of the School of Political Arts that
we are starting at Sciences Po in Paris this fall. How can you have a
”representative democracy” without changing the forms and the forums by which
issues are represented? The Public is to be composed, and the State rediscovered.
