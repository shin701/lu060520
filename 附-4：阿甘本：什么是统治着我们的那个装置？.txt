 附-4：阿甘本：什么是统治着我们的那个装置？
I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture,orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions. or discourses of living
beings. Not only, therefore. prisons. mad houses,the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines,juridical measures. and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy. agriculture,
cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones,and-why not-language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses-one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the
consequences t h at he was about to face.
主体和主体性就成了这样一种东西：To recapitulate, we have then two great classes: living beings (or substances) and apparatuses. And, between these two, as a third class, subjects. I call a subject that which results from the rclation and, so to speak, from the relentless fight between living beings and apparatuses. Naturally, the substances and the subjects, as in ancient metaphysics, seem to overlap,but not completely. In this sense, for example, the same individual, the samc substance, can be the place
of multiple processes of subjectification: the user of cellular phones, the web surfer, the writer of stories,the tango aficionado, the anti-globalization activist, and so on and so forth. The boundless growth of apparatuses in our time corresponds to the equally extreme
proliferation in processes of subjectification.
This may produce the impression that in our time, the category of subjectivity is wavering and losing its consistency; but what is at stake, to be precise, is not an erasure or an overcoming, but rather a dissemination that pushes to the extreme the masquerade that has always accompanied every personal identity.
对海德格尔式技术论的批判：
Here lies the vanity of the well-meaning discourse on technology, which asserts that the problem with apparatuses can be reduced to the question of their correct use. Those who make such claims seem to ignore
a simple fact: If a certain process of subjectification (or, in this case, desubjecti fication) corresponds to every  apparatus, then it is impossible for the subject of an apparatus ro use it ”in the right way.” Those who continue ro promote similar arguments are, for their part,the product of the m edia apparatus in which they are
captured.
