内杰里论库哈斯
=============================
发布时间：2010-09-25 23:54
 在城市空间里，资本更活跃，对劳动的剥削也更疯狂，但是诸众也更易在此汲聚和重新居有由劳动生出来的智力资本和共同物，所以，城市不光是一个的剥削之地，也是一个人类出走之地。你从这一眼光看去，一切还得重新开始。库哈斯对于城市的垃圾空间的重视，仍是浅薄的，那里撕开和撕出的一点点自由和解放，是仍配不上人类的。库哈斯对人类的生物权力政治完全无知。他对于透明和开放的要求由此看去仍是虚伪的。都市空间应该成为偶遇和斗争之地。它是人类必将废弃之地，是那个我们忆苦思甜时才提起的埃及。创意离解放不仅太远，而且太自欺。建筑事务所不光应该成为政治事务所，而且，在新政治，它必须有与旧秩序同归于尽、甚至身先士卒的献身精神。在人类的新的出埃及记里，建筑师担任的是一个什么样的角色呢？
In the Fordist factories,
the hardship of production and the joy of the encounter,
of being together, and of being a class, coexisted just
like solitude and multitude now coexist in the metropolis.
The metropolis is constant capital in action, a mad expropriation of labour-power; but also the place
where the multitude reappropriates intellectual capital
and the common produced by labour. Therefore, the
metropolis is at once a place of exploitation and a
terrain of exodus. As the hegemony of the factory
worker was built on the communist project, so the
hegemony of immaterial labour and the cognitive
multitude of the metropolis can be built inside and
against the project of production, in the common. From
this realization everything can and must start again.
I really do not know what the architects trapped
in the grip of the crisis of modernity can do. It seems
to me that they need to decide how to interpret the
relation between inclusion and disjuncture, the productive
relation that extends between metropolis and
multitude. Will it be possible to open up the chance for
encounter and struggles in the metropolis? Certainly
enclosures of resistance and of spaces for utopia are
not desirable. Beyond the hypocritical transparency
of the hypermodern, beyond the illusion that urban
spaces can be gentrified by Tony Blair’s ‘creative
classes’ (here Junkspace really does become a weapon
of demystification and struggle), we need to free new
forms of life and search for new structures of community
that tend towards exodus. I almost laugh when
my closest comrades talk about alternatives in terms of
communes, self-managed gardens and city allotments,
multifunctional squats, cultural and political ateliers,
enterprises of a common Bildung. The cynical realism
of the postmodern has earned my criticism but, starting
from its realism and under no illusion that the city is
entrusted to the exercise of biopower, I ask myself what
it would mean to return the metropolis to biopolitical
production. In the framework of Bigness, not of
craftsmanship, but of the General Intellect, perhaps
we only need to start talking about communism and
democracy again.
