=============================

 Other artists only have a commercial strategy of nullity, one to which they give a marketable form, the sentimental form of commodity艺术品是一种感伤的商品, as Baudelaire said. They hide behind their own nullity and behind the metastases of the discourse on art, which generously promotes this nullity as a value (within the art market as well, obviously). In a way, it is worse than nothing, because it means nothing and it nonetheless exists, providing itself with all the right reasons to exist. This paranoia in collusion with art means that there is no longer any possible critical judgment, and only an amiable, necessarily genial sharing of nullity. Therein lies the conspiracy of art and its primal scene, transmitted by all of the openings, hangings, exhibitions, restorations, collections, donations and speculations, and that cannot be undone in any known universe, since ithas hidden itself from thought behind the mystification of images（艺术躲到图像的神秘背后，来逃避思想的判断）（《艺术的阴谋》）.
