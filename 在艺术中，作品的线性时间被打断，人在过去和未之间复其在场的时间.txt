在艺术中，作品的线性时间被打断，人在过去和未之间复其在场的时间

 正如其它的神话传统想要激活原初的神秘时间，去与神同时代，达到创造的原初层面，在艺术中，作品的线性时间被打断，人在过去和未之间复其在场的时间。去观看一个艺术品，这意味着冲进一个更原初的时间，意味着韵律的载天辟地的开放中的一种狂喜）it means （在对艺术品的体验中，人站到了真理中，站到了在诗性的行动上中揭示给他的源泉头中）. 
艺术在今天已失去其原衩结构。在其形而上命运的尽头处，我们看到，艺术已成为一种虚无的力量，只是一种自我消失的无了，正彷徨在审美领域的沙漠中。它的异化是根本异化，是人的原衩历史空间的异化。艺术的异化，表明人已发挥作用去了他的使他成为人、能在其中行动上和认知的那一世界空间。
人一旦失去其诗性地位，他无法在别的事上重建其尺度。大难处会不会有大拯救，艺术会不会将人在地球上的尺度当尺度？

opening to man his authentic temporal dimension, the work of art also opens
for him the space of his belonging to the world, only within which he can take
the original measure of his dwelling on earth and find again his present truth
in the unstoppable flow of linear time.
In this authentic temporal dimension, the poetic status of man on earth finds
its proper meaning. Man has on earth a poetic status, because it is poiesis
that founds for him the original space of his world. Only because in the poetic
ποχ he experiences his being-in-the-world as his essential condition does a
world open up for his action and his existence. Only because he is capable of
the most uncanny power, the power of pro-duction into presence, is he also
capable of praxis, of willed and free activity. Only because he attains, in the
poetic act, a more original temporal dimension is he a historical being, for
whom, that is, at every instant his past and future are at stake.
Thus the gift of art is the most original gift, because it is the gift of the original
site of man（阿甘本《无内容的人》，62-64）.
