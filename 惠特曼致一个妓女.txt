 Walt Whitman (1819–1892).   Leaves of Grass.  1900. 
他歌颂罪犯和法官,他让一切人生都平等,让我感到很舒服,好象他为我作了开脱.
他说:你已是我的姑娘了,在我来会你之前,你要好好打扮,配得上我们的热烈相逢,在此这前,我也要...但不要紧张,我liberal, 我lusty...想象我们将多么自由地相遇,或让我们期待我们的意外的邂逅...
106. To a Common Prostitute 
            BE composed—be at ease with me—I am Walt Whitman, liberal and lusty as Nature;                         Not till the sun excludes you, do I exclude you;                         Not till the waters refuse to glisten for you, and the leaves to rustle for you, do my words refuse to glisten and rustle for you.                                           My girl, I appoint with you an appointment—and I charge you that you make preparation to be worthy to meet me,                         And I charge you that you be patient and perfect till I come.                  5                                  Till then, I salute you with a significant look, that you do not forget me.
