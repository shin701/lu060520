一个年青的庸俗马克思主义者的看法

 说得够庸俗，但其常识实在是坚硬：
As a young and very vulgar Marxist I tried to get to grips with the prophet's notion of base and superstructure. As I understood it, economic conditions would determine political and social movements. Taking modern Britain, for all that any country is beset by problems (lost discs, bingers, drug takers or Scottish Nationalists), the underlying facts were - are - that mortgages had become cheapo, unemployment was low, crime was, in general, falling, the economy was performing better than in most other similar countries and there were huge infrastructural improvements, as evidenced in new school buildings and hospitals. So one might expect that the unspectacular Mr Brown, even if not loved and occasionally maladroit, should be at least be moderately respected.
Of course, there is a deal of nervousness around. All this talk of negative equity is alarming, as are recent increases in the cost of oil and food. But even as the furore has developed about the fate of the losers from the abolition of the 10ptax band, there has been almost no notice taken at all of the winners from the impending cut in the basic rate. It isn't true that, under Mr Brown, the poor have got poorer, but it is the case that the very rich are very much richer. We have not yet devised a system that cuts them down to size without jeopardising wealth creation.
But the facts that constitute the “base” seem to mean little. Different groups in society compete with each other for status as Brown's victims. This leaves a lag between the story that is being told and the underlying reality - a lag that really ought to be filled by those people that wish the Government well. Then at least there could be an argument.
