思想是生活的形式，是那不能被隔离到其形式中的生活

 The diffuse intellectuality I am talking about and the
Marxian notion of a ”general intellect”lO acquire their
meaning only within the perspective of this experience.
They name the multitudo that inheres to the power of
thought as such（隐含于、内在于我们的思想中的诸众）. Intellectuality and thought are not a
form of life among others in which life and social production
articulate themselves, but they are rather the
unitary power that constitutes the multiple forms of life as
form-oflife. In the face of state sovereignty, which can
affirm itself only by separating in every context naked
life from its form, they are the power that incessantly
reunites life to its form or prevents it from being dissociated
from its form. The act of distinguishing between
the mere, massive inscription of social knowledge into
the productive processes (an inscription that characterizes
the contemporary phase of capitalism, the society
of the spectacle) and intellectuality as antagonistic power
and form-of-life such an act passes through the experience
of this cohesion and this inseparability. Thought
is form-of-life, life that cannot be segregated from its
form思想是生活的形式，是那不能被隔离到其形式中的生活; and anywhere the intimacy of this inseparable life
appears, in the materiality of corporeal processes and of
habitual ways of life no less than in theory, there and only
there is there thought（只有这一无法我们分离的生命出现，在好运一身体过程的物质性中，生命和理论中的习惯过程中，才有思想，也只有其中才会有思想）. And it is this thought, this formof-
life, that, abandoning naked life to ”Man” and to the
”Citizen,” who clothe it temporarily and represent it with
their ”rights,” must become the guiding concept and the
unitary center of the coming politics（这样的思想才应该成为未来的政治的凝合中心）（阿甘本《没有目的的手段》，8。9）.
