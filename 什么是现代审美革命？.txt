什么是现代审美革命？

 当艺术品不再是为某些人了之后，新的体验形式对每一个人都开放了。审美经验的这种乌托邦潜能，最早体现在康德-席勒的审美经验自治论里。艺术与生活在伦理上是对等的。社会精英和工人农民在审美体验上处于平等地位。艺术事关去为一种未被期待的能力开创一个空间，这也意味着这那些未被期待的可能性预留出空间。艺术的真正自治事关平等：是对每一个人的能力的平等的认识和重申（朗西埃《你无法指望炸》）。
现代审美革命是现代政治革命的继续，其主题是平等：作品主题、形式、材料和解释者之间是平等的。但这种审美革命越来越掉入市场的圈套，到了我们当代的概念艺术家手里，成为艺术家向市场出卖IDEA，通过出卖idea来反抗这个使他们的出卖横征暴敛以可能的资本主义市场社会。
If you cut off the head of the king, then, yes, it’s a radical break;
if you design a new kind of constitution, which gives new rights to the population, new
capacities to the people, etc., you can say that there is a radical break. But in the field
of art, it’s quite difficult to define the moment of radical break. This is true for forms of
art, and it is also true for their social and political implementation. Let us take the case
of abstract art, which has often been thought of as the right example of artistic break.
As a matter of fact, this break had been anticipated from the nineteenth century by a
move in the way painting was looked at. In the nineteenth-century prose of art
criticism, you can see this shift of the gaze that makes it so that figurative paintings are
more and more viewed with an ‘‘abstract eye,’’ which sees in them no longer the story
or anecdotes but the events of matter and color. In that way ‘‘realist’’ writers of the
nineteenth century, like the Goncourts, created the conditions of visibility of
‘‘abstract’’ painting. The dismissal of figurative painting is part of a much wider
process, which may itself be viewed in terms of evolution or in terms of revolutionary
break. Abstract forms, as Dima said, were about the construction of new buildings and
new settings. At this point, the question is to what extent we can connect the
‘‘destructive’’ moment with a political break. The glorification of ‘‘function’’ in the
revolution of architecture and design, from the Werkbund to the Bauhaus and l’Esprit
nouveau, was intended as a reaction against the nineteenth-century bourgeois
imitation of aristocratic styles, but it led to the achievement of a new capitalistic
and Fordist rationality as well as to the idea of a workers’ new world.
