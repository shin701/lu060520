 Unfortunately, politicians remain opposed to allowing high prices to do what high prices do best: curtail demand and increase supplies. So here and in Britain they try to find ways of bringing prices down — by brow-beating oil-company executives, or promising to lower petrol taxes, or begging the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries for mercy. In America, areas in Alaska and off-shore California, Florida and other states remain closed to exploration and development, while politicians responsible for these bans rail against Opec for not producing more oil.
Vladimir Putin, eager to stem the decline in Russia’s oil production, is reducing the tax burden on his nation’s oil companies to increase their incentive to drill and produce high-priced oil. America’s politicians, the Democrats leading the way, want to raise taxes on US oil firms, never mind the supply-side effect of such a move. “Across the world,” writes Zakaria, “economics is trumping politics.” Unfortunately, the triumph of economics is not yet complete in Washington DC.
