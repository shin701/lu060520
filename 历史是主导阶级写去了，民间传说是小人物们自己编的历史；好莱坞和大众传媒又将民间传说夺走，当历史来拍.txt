历史是主导阶级写去了，民间传说是小人物们自己编的历史；好莱坞和大众传媒又将民间传说夺走，当历史来拍

 You twonk, Ridley. From the Bayeux Tapestry and Domesday Book through Magna Carta to the Breton lays, it was the Norman nobility who wrote all the history in the first place. It's always the upper classes, the exploiters and administrators, who get to tell the story.
There's nothing new at all about seeing things through their eyes.
That's the whole point of Robin Hood - that the down-trodden underclass, the exploited and the weak get to have their version told too.
For the past few years, history teaching in schools has endeavoured to press home this point, to give a voice back to the odd woman, prole or black person who has featured in British history - largely in an attempt to make history more interesting to women, black people and proles. And now Sir Ridley wants to take it all away from them again. Is 21st-century Britain so conformist, right-wing and hidebound by convention and regulation that we really want to hear the sheriff's side of it? The policeman's version?
Indeed, so silenced was the voice of the common man in Norman England that the balladeers had to make up Robin (anointing him in later versions with that spurious “Earl of Locksley” mantle because even the plebs needed their saviour to be a nobleman). That's what folklore is: the sad, unrealised, fictional version of history created by the plucky losers.
