成为列宁

 我们被摔倒进后资本主义式的历史终结处，我们落进一个前无古人后无来者的open situation，齐泽克说，这是一个典型的列宁处境。列宁可以让他的同伴甚至全体苏维埃甚至全体无产阶级相信，革命也就是将国家机器掌握在自己手中的时间到了，没什么好准备的了，再去启蒙和教育无产阶级、再去作理论和思想的准备，等待时机的成熟，我们就会得官能症，永远陷于到底迈左脚还是右脚的困境中了（《重复列宁》）。
我们理论和思想如果没有这样的眼光的指引，那它们就成了病人对于自己的症状的自恋式叙述，越来越将我们自己绕进去。
in October 1917, Lenin claimed that ”we can at once set in motion a state apparatus constituting of ten if not twenty million people.”32 This urge of the moment is the true utopia. One cannot overestimate the explosive potential of The State and Revolution — in this book, ”the vocabulary and grammar of the Western tradition of politics was abruptly dispensed with.”33 What then followed can be called, borrowing the title of Althusser's text on Machiavelli, la solitude de Lenine: the time when he basically stood alone, struggling against the current in his own party. When, in his ”April Theses” from 1917, Lenin discerned the Augenblick, the unique chance for a revolution, his proposals were first met with stupor or contempt by a large majority of his party colleagues. Within the Bolshevik party, no prominent leader supported his call to revolution, and Pravda took the extraordinary step of dissociating the party, and the editorial board as a whole, from Lenin's ”April Theses” — far from being an opportunist flattering and exploiting the prevailing mood of the populace, Lenin's views were highly idiosyncratic. Bogdanov characterized ”April Theses” as ”the delirium of a madman,”34 and Nadezhda Krupskaya herself concluded that ”I am afraid it looks as if Lenin has gone crazy.”35
”Lenin” is not the nostalgic name for old dogmatic certainty; quite on the contrary, to put it in Kierkegaard's terms, THE Lenin which we want to retrieve is the Lenin-in-becoming, the Lenin whose fundamental experience was that of being thrown into a catastrophic new constellation in which old coordinates proved useless, and who was thus compelled to REINVENT Marxism — recall his acerb remark apropos of some new problem: ”About this, Marx and Engels said not a word.” The idea is not to return to Lenin, but to REPEAT him in the Kierkegaardian sense: to retrieve the same impulse in today's constellation. The return to Lenin aims neither at nostalgically reenacting the ”good old revolutionary times,” nor at the opportunistic-pragmatic adjustment of the old program to ”new conditions,” but at repeating, in the present world-wide conditions, the Leninist gesture of reinventing the revolutionary project in the conditions of imperialism and colonialism, more precisely: after the politico-ideological collapse of the long era of progressism in the catastrophe of 1914.
