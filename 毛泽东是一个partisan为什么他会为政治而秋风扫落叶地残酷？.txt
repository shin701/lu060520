毛泽东是一个partisan?为什么他会为政治而秋风扫落叶地残酷？

 施米特的《党争论》中，他指出真正的政治、真正的兄弟相煎的政治，是那些真正的partisan干出来的；是后者使得政治成为一种永远的流沙一样的风云之地：
In fact, it seems that it's the very intensity of the partisan's engagement that installs the partisan in this zone of indistinction between legal and illegal, military and civilian. Because of his commitments, his intensity, the partisan is willing to take risks, to act in a risky way, indeed, a way that places the entire population at risk insofar as the presence of the partisan blurs distinctions between military and civilian:
The word risky takes on an even more pregnant meaning, when he who acts in a risky way exposes himself personally to the danger and also takes into account the eventual negative consequences of his actions or of his omissions, so that he cannot consider it an injustice when these consequences hit him. ...
Not only does he risk his own life, as every regular combatant, but he knows, and for him everything depends on this fact, that the enemy considers him outside of every law, honor, and legality...
such absolute weapons of mass destruction require a foe not to appear inhuman . . . Those men who use these weapons against other men feel compelled to destroy these other men, i.e., their victims, even morally. They must brand their opponents as criminal and inhuman, as an absolute non-value, otherwise, they themselves would become criminals and monsters.
政治是不清晰和未决定的。一个搞政治的好手是要造成永久的不稳定，通过技术、媒体、战争等手段，造成时间和空间上的不稳定。在全球资本主义系统中，这样的党争，是很重要的士毛泽东正是在这一点上被西方人看重。
