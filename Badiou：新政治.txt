=============================

 But today, maybe, we have to create a new trend of politics, beyond the domination of the places, beyond social, national, racial places, beyond gender and religions. A purely displaced politics, with absolute equality as its fundamental concept.
This sort of politics will be an action without place. An international and nomadic creation with-as in a work of art-a mixture of violence, abstraction and final peace.
We have to organize a new trend in politics beyond the law of places and of centralisation of power. And in fact, we have to find a form of action where the political existence of everybody is not separated from its being, a point where we exist in so intense a fashion that we forget our internal division. Doing so we become a new subject.
Not an individual, but a part of a new subject.
