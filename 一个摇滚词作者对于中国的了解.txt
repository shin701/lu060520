Our second question is that of China, its place in the world and the kind of society into which it is evolving. China, like Russia before it, was driven by historical circumstance to move directly from feudalism to communism without any intermediate phases, and both are now retracing their steps back to capitalism. In China's case, this means a unique form of state capitalism that still retains many of the authoritarian practices common to both the feudal and communist stages of its history.
Old-fashioned totalitarian societies control information by suppressing what they consider inconvenient for their people to hear, while the more sophisticated capitalist democracies control information by swamping the truth in a deluge of disinformation, through which it is virtually a full-time job to sift.
China's national narrative is veined with an ingrained distrust of the outside world: a lengthy period of utter isolation was followed by the opium wars (courtesy of Britain) and some nasty interactions with Japan, the reverberations of both still with us.
Hence China's battles with Google and the Great Firewalls the country's techies erect around the internet; hence its fear of instability, whether generated internally or externally; hence the repression involved in the cases of Ai W-ei==wei, Li==u Xiao==bo and others less celebrated.
These are not the manifestations of a secure or confident society, especially one considered in the west to be the coming masters of the new century and a phenomenon almost as terrifying as that of globalised Islamism.
Ultimately, it all comes down to fear and paranoia. In the west, we're scared of Islam and China; in China they're still scared of Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, who are considered over here to be a bunch of eccentric pensioners who shot their respective bolts half a century back. Everybody concerned needs, essentially, to grow the hell up… and lighten the hell up. The times are always a-changin', just neither as much as some of us hope, or as much as some of us fear.
