Timothy Garton Ash：China arrives as a world power today - and we should welcome it
=============================

 In the longer run, the Chinese question of questions remains: can you continue to combine command politics with market economics? Or, to frame it more positively: can you achieve a controlled, step-by-step evolution of this political system into one that is more responsive, transparent, accountable and therefore durable?
Let us optimistically assume, for the sake of argument, that China masters these domestic challenges and continues its peaceful rise. What then? What kind of world power would it wish to be? Nobody knows, not even the Chinese. The answer will depend on a generation of leaders not yet in power, and on younger Chinese whose views are scarcely formed. One cannot simply extrapolate forward from the attitudes of older generations seared by memories of colonialism, civil war and the cultural revolution.
。。。
It seems likely that for the foreseeable future China will continue to put a very high value on unquestioned sovereignty (of the kind most European states no longer practise or preach), on the unity of the motherland (including Tibet), on a many-holds-barred kind of respect (being sensitive to any hint of colonial-style humiliation), and on the requirements of its own economic development. So long as cross-straits relations with Taiwan can be improved by political and economic means, China - unlike Russia - shows no signs of being a revisionist, let alone an expansionist, power. Its current foreign policy style, though often stubborn, is peaceful, cautious, pragmatic and evolutionary.
Beyond this, no one knows how China will behave as a major player in the international system when it is called upon, whether it likes it or not, to speak and act on issues far removed from its domestic concerns. Unlike in the case of the US, Britain or France, China's history of the last 200 years does not offer a set of foreign policy traditions - such as the Jeffersonian, Jacksonian, Hamiltonian and Wilsonian ones detected in US foreign policy by Walter Russell Mead - that are reference points for future action as a great power. Some analysts, western and Chinese, attempt to reach further back into Chinese history, to the traditions of Confucianism or so-called legalism, to discover buried cultural signposts. Intriguing though this is, the leap is a big one.
So it's a fair guess that Chinese policymakers will make their tradition up as they go along. If Deng Xiaoping's pragmatic recipe for domestic reform was ”crossing the river by feeling for the stones”, China will cross the oceans by testing the water as it goes. This means that a great deal will depend on the welcome it gets from the powers that still set much of the agenda of world politics, especially the United States and the European Union. In short, the process of defining what kind of world power China becomes will be deeply interactive.
