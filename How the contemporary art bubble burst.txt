How the contemporary art bubble burst

 I can see it 20 years from now. A room in Tate Britain, dedicated to the art of the first decade of the 21st century. The title of the exhibition is The Baubles of the Bubble Billionaires and on the wall an explanatory panel reads: “The first decade of the 21st century saw the greatest rise in the value of art in the history of the world. An unprecedented rise in global wealth, the availability of cheap credit and a widespread craze for art played a part, but speculation, secret deals and tax concessions for art collectors were equally important. The art of this era is defined by expense and simplicity. It was often fabricated with precious materials, such as platinum, gold and diamonds, but the forms it took were simple, inspired by cartoons, billboard adverts, wrapping paper and jewellery.”
On one wall there will be a triptych of canvases, each painted a single bright colour, each with 20 butterflies glued on. Beside it will be another one of those small gallery texts: “This is one of hundreds of butterfly paintings produced in the studios of Damien Hirst in the first decade of the millennium. During the credit boom, art dealers and collectors believed that this decorative design was a powerful symbol of life and death, nature and art. Newly minted billionaires spent up to ￡2 million each on these works. They were not deterred by the potentially infinite number of these works available since, at the time, art critics argued that mass-production and repetition were the new values in art.” For centuries to come, the air around these works will echo with titters of derision and snorts of scorn from gallery visitors reading about this daft world.
