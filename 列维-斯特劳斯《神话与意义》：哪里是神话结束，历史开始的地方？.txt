列维-斯特劳斯《神话与意义》：哪里是神话结束，历史开始的地方？

 We are not at all aware in our daily life that we are exactly in the same situation in
relation to different historical accounts written by different historians. We pay attention
only to what is basically similar, and we neglect the differences due to the fact that the
way historians carve the data and the way they interpret them are not exactly the same.
So if you take two accounts by historians, with different intellectual traditions and
different political leanings, of such events as the American Revolution, of the French-
English war in Canada, or the French Revolution, we are not really so shocked that they
don’t tell us exactly the same thing.
Thus my impression is that by studying carefully this history, in the general sense of
the word, which contemporary Indian authors try to give us of their own past, by not
considering this history as a fanciful account, but by trying extremely carefully, with the
help of a type of salvage archaeology—excavating village sites referred to in the
histories—and by trying to establish correspondences, inasmuch as this is possible,
between different accounts, and by trying to find what really corresponds and what does
not correspond, we may in the end reach a better understanding of what historical science
really is.
I am not far from believing that, in our own societies, history has replaced mythology
and fulfils the same function, that for societies without writing and without archives the
aim of mythology is to ensure that as closely as possible—complete closeness is
obviously impossible—the future will remain faithful to the present and to the past. For
us, however, the future should be always different, and ever more different, from the
present, some difference depending, of course, on our political preferences. But
nevertheless the gap which exists in our mind to some extent between mythology and
history can probably be breached by studying histories which are conceived as not at all
separated from but as a continuation of mythology（18）.
