此人下南的观点全是脱口而出，这种古典能力是政治家和教师起码应该具备的：
The higher education system will, in his view, have to change dramatically to cope with the new financial reality. “We are trying to provide the same universities for everyone as the number of students increase. It’s all about equality of esteem, all universities have to do the same thing. That’s preposterous, insane. At the same time we want to defend our competitive research base — well, we can’t do both. The biggest worry is that we don’t change the sector, we just squeeze everything.”
His solution would be community colleges, state universities and Ivy League-style institutions, like the Americans have. “It would be more like the old polytechnic system. We need to start from the premise that these establishments need to do different things. America has 3,000 institutions granting degrees but only 220 which are serious research universities. In Europe we have 2,000 universities and they all feel entitled to do research. It’s ludicrous.”
There will be a brain drain because academics have fared so poorly over the past decade compared with other professionals, such as doctors and head teachers. “Of course academics should be paid more, it’s a valuable job and there aren’t many spin-offs if you’re an expert on Greek linguistics.”
