 黑格尔:也是尼采:Roaming in thought over the universe, I saw the littlethat is Good steadily hastening towards immortality,
And the vast all this is called Evil I saw hastening to merge itself and become lost and dead(”Roaming...”).
诗人是干什么的:For I bestow upon any man or woman the entrance to all the gifts of the universe(”To Rich Givers”).
