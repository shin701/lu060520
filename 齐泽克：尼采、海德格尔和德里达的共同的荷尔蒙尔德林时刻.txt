 Perhaps, this brings us to the limits of the Derridean deconstruction of metaphysics. Three thinkers as different as Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Derrida, all conceive their own age as that of the critical turning point of metaphysics: in their (our) time, metaphysics has exhausted its potentials, and the thinker’s duty is to prepare the ground for a new, post-metaphysical, thinking… More generally, the entire Judeo-Christian history, up to our postmodernity, is determined by what one is tempted to call the Hoelderlin paradigm which was first articulated by Saint Augustine in The City of God: “Where the danger is grows also what can save as.” /Wo aber Gefahr ist weachst das Rettende auch./ The present moment appears as the lowest point in the long process of historical decadence (the flight of Gods, alienation…), but the danger of the catastrophic loss of the essential dimension of being-human also opens up the possibility of a reversal /Kehre/—proletarian revolution, the arrival of new gods (which, according to the late Heidegger, can only save us), etc. Are we able to imagine a “pagan” non-historical universe, a universe thoroughly outside this paradigm, a universe in which (the historical) time just flows, with no teleological curvature, in which the idea of a dangerous moment of decision (Benjamin’s Jetzt-Zeit) out of which a “bright future” which will redeem the past itself can emerge, is simply meaningless?
Although this Hlderlin paradigm is usually identified with Christianity, Christianity, at its most radical, nonetheless seems to give a unique twist to it: everything that has to happen ALREADY HAPPENED, there is nothing to wait for, we do not have to wait for the Event, for the arrival of Messiah, the Messiah has already arrived, the Event already took place, we live in its aftermath. This basic attitude of historical CLOSURE is also the message of Hegel, of his dictum that the Owl of Minerva takes off in the twilight—and what is difficult, but crucial, to grasp is how this stance, far from condemning us to passive reflection, opens up the space for active intervention. And does the same not go for Kierkegaard who, in spite of his standard rumblings against the mass-society of the “present age,” also does not seem to rely on the Hlderlin paradigm of historicality (and on the hubris in the self-perception of the thinker that such a view involves): there is nothing really exceptional about our age, if anything, we leave in ordinary and non-interesting times（《请回到迟延》）?
