阿甘本、科耶夫：历史终结后，人成为动物
=============================

 历史终结后，人成为动物，他生活在富足和完全的安全中，他通过艺术、性爱和游戏来获得满足（科耶夫《黑格尔演讲导论》）。
If Man becomes an animal again, his arts, his loves, and his play must
also become purely ”natural” again. Hence it would have to be admitted
that after the end of History, men would construct their edifices
and works of art as birds build their nests and spiders spin their webs,
would perform musical concerts after the fashion of frogs and cicadas,
would playas young animals play, and would indulge in love like
adult beasts. But one cannot then say that all this ”makes Man
happy.” One would have to say that post-historical animals of the
species Homo sapiens (which will live amidst abundance and complete
security) will be content as a result of their artistic, erotic, and playful
behavior, inasmuch as, by definition, they will be contented with it. L
历史终结后人的状况：只有自然世界一直保留下去，人对于给定物的否定将不再，哲学将不再，因为，人从此用不着本质地改变自己了。但其余的使幸福的一切，则都可以被保留下来（导论）：
The disappearance of Man at the end of History is not a cosmic
catastrophe: the natural World remains what it has been from all
eternity. And it is not a biological catastrophe either: Man remains
alive as animal in harmony with Nature or given Being. What disappears
is Man properly so called-that is, Action negating the given,
and Error, or, in general, the Subject opposed to the Object. In point
of fact, the end of human Time or History-that is, the definitive
annihilation of Man properly so called or of the free and historical
Individual-means quite simply the cessation ofAction in the strong
sense of the term. Practically, this means: the disappearance of wars
and bloody revolutions. And the disappearance of Philosophy, for
since Man no longer changes himself essentially, there is no longer
any reason to change the (true) principles which are at the basis of
his knowledge of the World and of himself. But all the rest can be
preserved indefinitely; art, love, play, etc., etc.; in short, everything
that makes Man happy.
接受美国生活方式，就是人正在成为动物的明证：the ”American way of life” was the type of life proper to the post-historical
period, the current presence of the United States in the World
prefiguring the future ”eternal present” of all humanity. Thus, man's
return to animality appeared no longer as a possibility that was yet to
come, but as a certainty that was already present.
