续论关于中国人的省钱到了美国人的国库里

 But even the Chinese do not see the dollar’s role being so diminished in the near-or medium-term future. Instead, they see themselves in the position that America was in vis-à-vis Britain in 1946. America is deeply in debt and digging itself in deeper every day. China, America’s principal creditor, is worried that Obama and his successors will attempt to pay back the more than $1 trillion they owe in wildly depreciated dollars. So it wants to see some plan coming out of the White House that will begin to reduce the deficit and, eventually, the national debt.
No such plan exists. Obama, who styles himself a “transformational president”, intends to keep the spending taps wide open. Unfortunately the old adage that if you owe your banker a huge sum you have him where you want him is not true — not if the Chinese are your creditor. So it should be no surprise that Obama is the first president to refuse to receive the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan leader, despite the urgings of the celebrity luvvies who helped fund the president’s election campaign. Or that America no longer presses the Chinese regime on human rights. All in an effort to keep the Chinese happy, and lending.
The Chinese have a couple of huge problems. Unless they maintain a growth rate of 5%+ they face social unrest on a huge scale and they are quite open about this. They can only do this if they keep their currency artificially low. If they do this they build up more and more US reserves. 
Secondly they face a demographic time bomb because of the single child policy. So they end up with an ageing population with a high level of savings that are effectively in US treasuries that could fall dramatically in value.
What would you do?
Add to renewed growth the stated willingness of the Fed to head off inflation, and we might not find ourselves in the position Britain was in after the second world war. Indeed, the Chinese might be so dependent on access to our markets to keep their economy growing, and their masses from revolting, that power will lie on our side of the bargaining table.
