齐泽克的一个隐喻
=============================

 On the southern side of the demilitarized zone that divides North
from South Korea, the South Koreans built a unique visitor’s site:
a theater building with a large screen-like window in front,
opening up onto the North. The spectacle people observe when
they take seats and look through the window is reality itself (or,
rather, a kind of “desert of the real”): the barren demilitarized
zone with walls etc., and, beyond, a glimpse of North Korea. As if
to comply with the fiction, North Korea has built in front of this
theater a pure fake, a model village with beautiful houses; in the
evening, the lights in all the houses are turned on at the same
time, people area given good dresses and are obliged to take a
stroll every evening… a barren zone is given a fantasmatic status,
elevated into a spectacle, solely by being enframed(齐泽克《建筑之位移》).
