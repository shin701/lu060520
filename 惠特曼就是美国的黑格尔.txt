 他是我们今天说的rapper,就是那种象说话那样唱歌的人.他的哲学比黑格尔迟一点,却是那么地相似,＜草叶集＞就是＜精神现象学＞!
＜自我之歌＞第16:
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others, Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuffed with the stuff that is coarde and stuffed with the stuff that is fine, 
One of the nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same...
第20:
In all people Isee myself, none more and not one  a barley-corn less,
And the good or bad Isay of myself I say of them...
I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,
And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.
