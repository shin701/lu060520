But this place wants to be loved. The instruction to be lovable comes from above, but the action comes from the heart. Already I feel that these Games are something to do with the commitment of at least a billion people.
It is the vanity of both the Olympic organisation and China: to maintain the fiction that we are all living happily ever after; to insist that now is precisely what our story was for. And it really doesn't fool anybody; it just suits the organisations in question to hold up the pretence.
   China is not a place of achieved perfection, any more than it is a place of unrestrained oppression. It is a country going through vast, high-speed traumatic changes; intellectual and political changes are lagging behind the brutal pace of economic advancement, but change is what is going on here - and much of the process is out of control.
