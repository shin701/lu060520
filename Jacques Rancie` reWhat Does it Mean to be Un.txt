 This is what is meant by my ‘outrageous’ or ‘nonsensical’ statement: politics as
such rests on the anarchical power of the un-qualified or un-identified. What we call
562 J. Rancie`re
in a single word ‘the political’ rests on a twofold logic. On the one hand, governors
govern on the grounds that they embody the power of birth, wealth, science or
enterprise and exercise the competencies attached to those qualifications. This is the
order of the police. On the other hand, those competencies are pressed into service, as
political competencies, in the name of a supplementary entitlement. Governors govern
on the grounds that they embody the power of the people, which means the power of
those who have no qualification for governing or being governed. They govern because
there is no reason why they should govern but that absence of reason. This is what
politics ultimately means. Such is the anarchical principle which both sustains the
edifice of political power and collapses it into ruins. This is why a weird affirmation of
the power of the un may sometimes lead the most solid ‘democratic’ governments to
the verge of collapse.
Its emancipatory potential has more than ever to be disentangled from a ‘critical’
tradition that has become the sophisticated version of the dominant order. It is not so
easy to be un. It is not so easy because, in a sense, it is too easy: we have wonderful tools
and methods for reading images, deconstructing discourses, unmasking the fallacies of
the media, etc. We easily settle into a comfortable relation with an enemy whose
messages have no secret for us. Perhaps we should lose some of this comfort and ask
ourselves what exactly we are doing with this smooth-running critical machinery: are
we framing a world of idiots where we play the part of the smart guys, or are we
framing new spaces for the manifestation of the un-qualification, which is to say, the
capacity of anybody?
