The iPhone and iPod are portable, but they are also highly personal bits of kit. Apple has created a virtuous circle — it creates toys we desire, and then uses our desire to personalise our toys to sell us more stuff. The more we love, the more we pay.
There is a reason for the biblical tinge in the tablet’s nicknames. This device is seen as a potential saviour of the written word.

Readership online is thriving, but proving hard to monetise; readership of traditional, paper-based media is falling, threatening sales and advertising revenues.
