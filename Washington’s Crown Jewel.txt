But if you have time for only one painting, see Miró’s golden, finely itemized work of abstract realism, “The Farm,” of 1921-2, in Gallery 404E. Miró painted his farm from the farmer’s point of view, as seen by someone who knew every pebble and leaf, every pigeon and coop, every bucket and seed. It is, like all paintings but a little more directly than some, a picture of human striving.

One of the choicest places to pause is Gallery 39, where you’ll find examples of the astounding realism favored in Germany and the Netherlands, such as Rogier van der Weyden’s luxuriously austere “Portrait of a Lady” of around 1460, her delicate face framed by white veils in a shape reminiscent of a sphinx.
