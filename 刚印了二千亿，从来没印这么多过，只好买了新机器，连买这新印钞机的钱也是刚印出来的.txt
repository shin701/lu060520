 这文章说，人民银行或国家银行刚印了二千亿，从来没印这么多过，只好买了新机器，连买这新印钞机的钱也是刚印出来的。
它印出钞票来买下资产，来刺激经济，等到经济好了，再回吐出去：
The Bank of England yesterday turned off the printing presses. It will not, for the moment, add to the ￡200 billion of assets, mostly gilts, that it has bought with newly minted central bank money.
So has the unprecedented policy of quantitative easing done the trick? Hardly. The picture of the economy painted by the Bank is pretty dismal. There is a strong argument that it should keep going. Inflation has picked up. But it should prove just a spike. Although the recession has probably knocked out some economic capacity permanently, output has fallen so far there will be slack in the system for a long time. All the signs are that the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee still believes the bigger threat is deflation rather than inflation. So why has the Bank stopped? It points out that, in a sense, it hasn’t. The stock of assets it has purchased, together with bank rate at 0.5 per cent, will provide monetary stimulus for some time. It has not said it will start selling those assets. Indeed, it emphasises that it may restart purchases if the outlook worsens. But it is unlikely to do that before the election.
Its caution is understandable, given the uncertainy over the longer-term impact of the easing strategy. There are also concerns about it adding to a stock of gilts that it could be difficult to unload without undermining the market. But there is a good alternative — buying more private sector securities. Unfortunately, this is strongly opposed by Mervyn King, the Governor.
The Bank may turn out to be right. It will be a shame if, having responded well to the crisis, if not in the run-up, the Bank has now dropped the ball.
