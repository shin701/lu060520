But they know what they think, they understand their own experiences

 And when you've done it for a while, a terrible thought begins to cross your mind. Is it really a good idea to put these people in charge? Many of them don't seem - how shall I put this - strikingly well informed. There are quite a lot of people with odd hobbyhorses. It doesn't take too many roads before you begin to wonder if this democracy lark hasn't been oversold.
Then, when you've pounded a few more pavements, you have second thoughts. People aren't that bothered with politics, it's true. But they know what they think, they understand their own experiences and they have a good feel for what's in their own interests and those of their neighbours. You realise that your first view was arrogant. You understand that a system that learns from the huge variety of people's experiences and instincts is better than some ideology you made up in your head after reading a load of books.
