 More than half of those with jobs at the top
American newspapers earn less than $25,000 per year, but successful freelance critics may write
twenty or thirty essays per year, at a base fee of $1,000 per essay or $1 to $2 per word, or $35 to
$50 for a brief newspaper review. (My own experience is probably about average; I have charged
between $500 and $4,000 for essays between one and twenty pages long.) Critics who are
actively writing will also be asked to lecture at art schools and travel to exhibitions, with all
expenses paid and fees between $1000 and $4000. Articles in glossy art magazines pay between
$300 and $3,000, and those essays can be used both to augment the critic’s income and generate
further invitations. By comparison an academic art historian or philosopher may easily spend a
long and productive career without ever being paid for any publication.
