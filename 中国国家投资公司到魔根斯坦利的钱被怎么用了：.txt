 In the case of Morgan Stanley, for example, the $5billion of new funding raised from the Chinese Government has been almost exactly matched by an increase in the bonus pool for payment to its supposedly talented employees. Citi, meanwhile, after paying out more than $100million to its sacked chief executive, is now planning to pay out roughly half the new capital it raised this week as a dividend next month.
一亿美元被用来付被取消合同的主管，一半付给股东红利！
这就是金融。
但中国也从西方人的消费之贪婪中得到好处，阿拉伯国家则从石油涨价中得利：
As a result, Asian and energy-producing sovereign wealth funds will soon become the biggest shareholders in most of the leading American and European financial institutions. In this sense, the bailouts of Citigroup and Merrill Lynch will be remembered as milestones, marking a decisive shift in the centre of gravity of the world economy towards Asia after five centuries of financial, economic and therefore political dominance by Europe and America.
Secondly, if the markets prove right in their initial pessimistic reaction, then these cash injections will inevitably be seen not as canny investments but as government bailouts. That, in turn, will imply the present global financial crisis simply cannot be solved by private market forces. If market confidence cannot be restored in stricken banks, however much new money they raise and whatever management changes they undertake, then governments and regulators around the world will be faced with a stark choice.
西方对亚洲的五个世纪的金融统治至少是动摇了！很有意思！这比从文化和政治上看更可靠！
