朗西埃：审美革命和艺术的命运

In sketching out these entropic scenarios of the politics of aesthetics,
I may seem to propose a pessimistic view of things. That is not at all
my purpose. Undeniably, a certain melancholy about the destiny of art
and of its political commitments is expressed in many ways today, especially
in my country, France. The air is thick with declarations about
the end of art, the end of the image, the reign of communications and
advertisements, the impossibility of art after Auschwitz, nostalgia for
the lost paradise of incarnate presence, indictment of aesthetic utopias
for spawning totalitarianism or commodification. My purpose has not
been to join this mourning choir. On the contrary I think that we can distance
ourselves from this current mood if we understand that the ‘end
of art’ is not a mischievous destiny of ‘modernity’, but the reverse side
of the life of art. To the extent that the aesthetic formula ties art to nonart
from the start, it sets up that life between two vanishing points: art
becoming mere life or art becoming mere art. I said that ‘pushed to the
extreme’, each of these scenarios entailed its own entropy, its own end
of art. But the life of art in the aesthetic regime of art consists precisely
of a shuttling between these scenarios, playing an autonomy against a
heteronomy and a heteronomy against an autonomy, playing one linkage
between art and non-art against another such linkage.
Each of these scenarios involves a certain metapolitics: art refuting the
hierarchical divisions of the perceptible and framing a common sensorancière:

rium; or art replacing politics as a configuration of the sensible world;
or art becoming a kind of social hermeneutics; or even art becoming, in
its very isolation, the guardian of the promise of emancipation. Each of
these positions may be held and has been held. This means that there
is a certain undecidability in the ‘politics of aesthetics’. There is a metapolitics
of aesthetics which frames the possibilities of art. Aesthetic art
promises a political accomplishment that it cannot satisfy, and thrives
on that ambiguity. That is why those who want to isolate it from politics
are somewhat beside the point. It is also why those who want it to fulfil
its political promise are condemned to a certain melancholy
