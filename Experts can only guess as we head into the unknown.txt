 通用的工人每小工会保障工资是70美元，丰田也有45美元。他们要与中国工人拉平，需要多少年？在国际贸易体系里，到底是谁在剥削谁？是美国工人剥削中国工人多，还是中国资本家剥削中国工人多？是什么造成了这种差异和差别？天，我的理论在这样的天方夜谈般的现实里是只能短路了。
到底危机要走到哪里，我们其实是不知道，专家其实也不知道：
But we have moved beyond the range of what we know about credit crunches. All we know is that the results so far have not matched the predictions of the proponents of these policies. Which is one reason why Paulson decided not to use the second half of his $700 billion, and to leave it to the next Congress and the incoming president to decide whether it might not be better to pass the remaining $350 billion direct to homeowners who are falling behind with their mortgage payments. Surely that would reduce foreclosures and repossessions, thereby easing the glut of unsold homes, raising prices and helping to bring the recession to an end. Surely? Better, perhaps.
美国是个欠债巨大的政府，但大家还是要把自己的货币变成美元，没地方躲！
