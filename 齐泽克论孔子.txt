 I. Legalists versus ConfuciansThe philosopher who tried to undermine the very possibility of such unwritten obscene rules was Immanuel Kant: in his “Perpetual Peace,” he grounds what he calls the “transcendental formula of public law” (“All actions relating to the right of other men are unjust if their maxim is not consistent with publicity.”) in the obvious reason that a secret law, a law unknown to its subjects, would legitimize the arbitrary despotism of those who exercise it: “A maxim which I cannot divulge without defeating my own purpose must be kept secret if it is to succeed; and, if I cannot publicly avow it without inevitably exciting universal opposition to my project, the necessary and universal opposition which can be foreseen a priori is due only to the injustice with which the maxim threatens everyone.” [8]
Thing, however, soon get ambiguous in Kant. As every Kant scholar knows apropos his prohibition to lie, one has always to be very attentive about exceptions to his universal maxims. In the Second Supplement to his “Perpetual Peace,” Kant asks a nave question: can the contract between states which obliges them to perpetual peace have a secret clause? Although he admits that a secret article in contracts under public law is objectively a contradiction, he allows an exception for subjective reasons. This clause is not what one would have expected, a clause allowing dirty realpolitical compromises in order to maintain peace, like to infamous secret clause of the Soviet-German Treaty from 1939 regulating the partition of Poland and other Eastern European states. It is, rather, something which may appear much more innocent, even ridiculous to make it the topic of a secret clause: “The opinions of philosophers on the conditions of the possibility of public peace shall be consulted by those states armed for war.” Why should this clause remain secret? If made public, it would appear humiliating to the legislative authority of a state: how can the supreme authority, to whom “we must naturally attribute the utmost wisdom,” seek instruction from its subjects? This may sound ridiculous, but do we not respect it even today? When Habermas was in England during Blair’s government, did Tony Blair not invite him to a discrete diner which was not reported in the media? Kant was thus right: this clause should remain secret, because it does something more horrible than bringing out the dark cynical underside of legal power (in today’s cynical era, a state power can proudly admit its dark side, flirting with the fact that it is discreetly doing dirty things it is better for us not to know them) — it brings out the blindness, stupidity and ignorance of power, a blindness which is not personal but institutional: in spite of hundreds of highly-educated experts, the result of the US invasion of Iraq are catastrophic.http://www.lacan.com/essays/?page_id=397
