 Have your say  McGrath's answers were very straight-forward, but his answer assumes that hte listener is able to think logically and has some background knowledge about teh general area. Dawkin's answers were full of handwaving -- oh scientists are working on it. Trust us. 
Oh and he seems to be ignorant of the fact that the very first scientists were Catholic (e.g. Albert the Great, Bacon, etc) 
He is also unware of the ”theory-laden” view of science.

Much is made of this supposed issue. Those who choose to believe in one or more of the diverse gods that human mythology offers, have thus stepped outside the possibility of discourse. To discuss something that is ”not of this world” is mere pretence, since its attributes depend solely upon the whim of the believer. 
Nowhere within the vast literature of all the worlds theologies is there even a scrap of evidence for a god - just stories, allegories, hints and innuendos about your fate if you don't agree. Magic is the recourse of the unhappy (or uneducated) who are unable to experience the excitement of living in a deeply complex universe - and the joy of unravelling its many mysteries. 
The ”immortal soul” is a bag over your head with pictures on the inside - available free from a church, temple or mosque near you.

McGrath comes from the Tony Blair school of answering questions. The words are eloquently spoken and in the right grammatical order, but completely devoid of any meaning. It seems his religion inspires him to commit himself to absolutely no viewpoint on any topic - ironically, the theist appears to be the nihilist. 
McGrath's positions are mirages - when one probes for something more solid from him, he evaporates into meaninglessness only to reappear elsewhere. In the end, it becomes tiring and timewasting.

Proof, as if proof were needed, that McGrath is constitutionally unable to give a straight answer to a straight question. There's theology for you.
