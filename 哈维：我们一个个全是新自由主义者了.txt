哈维：我们一个个全是新自由主义者了
=============================

 Not only does the subject-structure
of capital no longer correspond to (although it must
still articulate itself across) the territorially discrete
entities of nation-states, but the dominant forms of
economic subjectivation (of individuals as constituents
of variable capital and consumers of commodities) are
now accompanied by forms of financial subjectivation
(of individuals as subjects of loans, credit-card debt,
pensions, benefits, etc.) that further subsume labour to
capital in the sphere of its circulation. As Harvey has
put it, in another context: ‘There is a sense … in which
we have all become neoliberals.’28 In other words, there
are ‘counteracting tendencies’ not just to crises of
accumulation but to the formation of collective social
subjects through capitalist production as well.
