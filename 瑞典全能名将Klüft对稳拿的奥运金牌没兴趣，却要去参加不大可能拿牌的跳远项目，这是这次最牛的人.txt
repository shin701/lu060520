 I am a devotee of Klüft, who is an enthralling, brilliant and stunningly impressive human being. She is ever so slightly Swedish, but I have cheered for her as she won the heptathlon in overwhelming style in Athens, and I would have cheered for her here.But alas, she has decided not to compete in the heptathlon this year, because she doesn’t feel like it; not in the manner of a diva throwing a pout, but like a human being who doesn’t give a stuff. And this gives Sotherton a chance for a gold that simply wouldn’t exist if Klüft were about. So it’s not just performance that matters where medals are concerned, medals can be decided by all kinds of uncontrollable things, things such as the mood of an incandescently splendid athlete.
I really wish Klüft was doing the heptathlon. How could she just walk away? The answer is that her strength was always that she might walk away. The fact that competition wasn’t everything to her gave her added strength, put wings on her heels. She was free of many of the competitor’s traditional neuroses because she genuinely believed that it didn’t matter, that it was a bit of fun, that there were more important things in life.
She is here competing in the long jump — as well as the triple jump — because she still loves that. She won’t win it, she is aware of that. And if she didn’t have the ability to walk away from a gold medal, she would never have won one.
