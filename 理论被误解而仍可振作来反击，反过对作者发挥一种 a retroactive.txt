 齐泽克问：如果我们不将我们的误解加到这些后结构主义身上，他们还会是他们么？他们不正是我们想要他们成为的样子？
原汁原味地理解他们是可能的，不，是必要的么？文化研究式的历史主义是没有本体论保证的，但它仍可被历史来保证，找到落脚点。德里达不正是从美国那国对他的误解中重新找到其政治伦理攻击点之重心的？理论被误解而仍可振作来反击，反过对作者发挥一种 a retroactive
productive influence （齐泽克《用历史来反抗历史主义》）：
In short, an entity like ‘poststructuralist
deconstruction’ (the term itself is not used in France) comes
into existence only for a gaze that is unaware of the details of the philosophical
scene in France: this gaze brings together authors (Derrida, Deleuze,
Foucault, Lyotard...) who are simply not perceived as part of the
same episteme in France, in the same way that the concept of film noir
posits a unity which did not exist ‘in itself’. And in the same way that the
French gaze, ignorant of the ideological tradition of American individualist
anti-combo populism, misperceived through existentialist lenses the
heroic, cynical-pessimistic, fatalist stance of the noir hero for a socially
critical attitude, the American perception inscribed the French authors into
the field of radical cultural criticism and thus conferred on them the feminist
etc. critical social stance for the most part absent in France itself.4
And, furthermore, sometimes, the external misperception exerts a productive
influence on the misperceived ‘original’ itself, forcing it to become
aware of its own ‘repressed’ truth (arguably, the French notion of
noir, although the result of misperception, exerted a strong influence on
American movie making itself). Isn’t the supreme example of this productivity
of the external misperception the very American reception of Derrida?
Did it not — although it clearly was a misperception — exert a retroactive
productive influence on Derrida himself, forcing him to confront more
directly ethico-political issues? Was the American reception of Derrida in
this sense not a kind of pharmakon, a supplement to the ‘original’ Derrida
himself — a poisonous stain—fake, distorting the original and at the same
time keeping it alive? In short, would Derrida be still so much ‘alive’ if we
were to substract from his work its American misperception?
