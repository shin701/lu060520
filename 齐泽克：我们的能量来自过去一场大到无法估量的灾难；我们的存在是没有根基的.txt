 It is this distrust which makes ecology the ideal candidate for hegemonic ideology, since it echoes the anti-totalitarian
post-political distrust of large collective acts. This distrust unites religious leaders and environmentalists
- for both, there is something of a transgression, of entering a prohibited domain, in this idea of creating a
new form of life from scratch, from the zero-point. And this brings us back to the notion of ecology as the new
opium for the masses; the underlying message is again a deeply conservative one - any change can only be the
change for the worst - here is a nice quote from the TIME magazine on this topic:
Behind much of the resistance to the notion of synthetic life is the intuition that nature (or God) created the best
of possible worlds. Charles Darwin believed that the myriad designs of nature’s creations are perfectly honed to
do whatever they are meant to do - be it animals that see, hear, sing, swim or fly, or plants that feed on the sun’s
rays, exuding bright floral colours to attract pollinators.
This reference to Darwin is deeply misleading: the ultimate lesson of Darwinism is the exact opposite, namely
that nature tinkers and improvises, with great losses and catastrophes accompanying every limited success - is
the fact that 90 percent of the human genome is ‘junk DNA’ with no clear function not the ultimate proof of it?
Consequently, the first lesson to be drawn is the one repeatedly made by Stephen Jay Gould: the utter contingency
of our existence. There is no Evolution: catastrophes, broken equilibriums, are part of natural history; at
numerous points in the past, life could have turned into an entirely different direction. The main source of our
energy (oil) is the result of a past catastrophe of unimaginable dimensions. One should thus learn to accept the
utter groundlessness of our existence: there is no firm foundation, a place of retreat, on which one can safely
count. “Nature doesn’t exist”: “nature” qua the domain of balanced reproduction, of organic deployment into
which humanity intervenes with its hubris, brutally throwing off the rails its circular motion, is man’s fantasy;
nature is already in itself “second nature,” its balance is always secondary, an attempt to negotiate a “habit” that
would restore some order after catastrophic interruptions（《论审查：暴力或作为群众新鸦片的生态学》）.
