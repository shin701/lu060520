南西：为什么一切都政治了
=============================

 But politics is retraced as a place where power is exercised with a view
towards an incommensurable justice—that is, as a place where one asserts
an in-finity of human-being or of world-being. By definition, politics no
longer reabsorbs into itself all the other spaces of existence. The other spaces
are those where the incommensurability is in some sense formed and presented:
these can be called “art,” “religion,” “thought,” “science,” “ethics,” “conduct,”
“exchange,” “production,” “love,” “war,” “kinship,” “intoxication,” and
can, indeed, be given an infinite number of names: their mutual distinctions
and circumscriptions (that prevent neither contiguities nor co-penetrations)
define in each case the occurrence of a configuration according to
which takes place a certain presentation—even if this presentation itself
must give form to an “impresentation” or a withdrawal of presence.
(Nonetheless, the non-political spheres are both public and private, if one
must use such terms. All are, in the double sense of the word, partagées
[imparted or shared out; divided].)
Among these configurations (and, again, without excluding their contacts
and contagions), there is incommensurability. Politics is redrawn at the
place where one must keep open this incommensurability, whether that
means, generally, the incommensurability of justice, or that of value.
Contrary to the assertions of both theological politics and political economy—
but not without relation to what was at stake in the “pre-political”
polis (if one can put it that way)—politics is no longer the place of an
assumption of a unitotality. Neither is it the place where the incommensurability
of whatever type of unity of origin or of end—in short, of a “humanity”—
is given shape or brought to presence. Politics is in charge of space or
spacing (of space-time), but not in charge of figures.
