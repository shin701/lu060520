 最令人恶心者，莫过于那些革命的美丽心灵，后来竟不肯承认他们当初的关于自由的蓬勃梦想之真相，比如中国知识分子的羞于承认文革时对于政治自由的激动，事后大加混淆，不肯承认自己那时已被煽动起来的梦想：
Similarly, it is easy to
fall in love with the crazy creative unrest of the first years after the October Revolution,
with suprematists, futurists, constructivists, and so on, competing for primacy
in revolutionary fervor; it is much more difficult to recognize in the horrors of the
forced collectivization of the late 1920s the attempt to translate this revolutionary fervor
into a new positive social order.There is nothing ethically more disgusting than
revolutionary Beautiful Souls who refuse to recognize, in the Cross of the postrevolutionary
present, the truth of their own flowering dreams about freedom（齐泽克《多角度来看》，5）.
