                                                                                                                                    Man is this animal whose definitive property is to participate in numerous worlds and appear in innumerable places. This sort of objectal ubiquity, which makes it pass nearly constantly from one world to another against the background of the infinity of these worlds and their transcendental organization, is by itself, without having to recur to any sort of miracle, a grace: the purely logical grace of innumerable appearance. Every human animal can claim that it is excluded, that everywhere and always it encounters only atonality, inefficiency of the body or defect of capable organs to treat the points. Incessantly, in some accessible world, something arises. To every human animal is accorded, several times in its brief existence, the chance to be incorporated into the subjective present of a truth. To all, and for several types of procedures, the grace to live for an Idea is distributed and thus the grace to live tout court.
