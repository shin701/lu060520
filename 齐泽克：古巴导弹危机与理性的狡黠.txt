 For the first time in human history,
the act of a single socio-political agent effectively can alter and even interrupt the global historical process, so
that, ironically, it is only today that we can say that the historical process should effectively be conceived “not
only as Substance, but also as Subject.” This is why, when confronted with singular catastrophic prospects (say,
a political group which intends to attack its enemy with nuclear or biological weapons), we no longer can rely
on the standard logic of the “Cunning of Reason” which, precisely, presupposes the primacy of the historical
Substance over acting subjects: we no longer can adopt the stance of “let the enemy who threatens us deploy its
potentials and thereby self-destruct himself” - the price for letting the historical Reason do its work is too high
since, in the meantime, we may all perish together with the enemy. Recall a frightening detail from the Cuban
missile crisis: only later did we learn how close to nuclear war we were during a naval skirmish between an
American destroyer and a Soviet B-59 submarine off Cuba on October 27 1962. The destroyer dropped depth
charges near the submarine to try to force it to surface, not knowing it had a nuclear-tipped torpedo. Vadim Orlov,
a member of the submarine crew, told the conference in Havana that the submarine was authorized to fire it
if three officers agreed. The officers began a fierce, shouting debate over whether to sink the ship. Two of them
said yes and the other said no. “A guy named Arkhipov saved the world,” was a bitter comment of a historian
on this accident.
