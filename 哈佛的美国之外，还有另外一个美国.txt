 圣经、家庭和国旗，这是美国革命和美国民主的全部道具。文化出口，都被哈佛大学式的中产白领盘踞，只在向全世界制造那个新英格兰式的贪婪的占有者在有良好的ｆｉｎａｎｃｉａｌ　ｓｉｔｕａｔｉｏｎ下的宁静的生活秩序。但还有那个要用枪用圣经来保卫的美国：
European visitors to the United States are mostly exposed to the East Coast culture; many Americans live wholly inside that culture. It is a culture of modernism, in no way to be despised, but it is not the only culture in America.
The view of the world from Harvard Yard is very different from the view from those states that Europeans seldom visit, and do not really understand. These are the states that have retained much of the religion, the practicality and the moral values of the frontier. In those states there is a conservative majority, based on the Bible, the Family and the Flag.
