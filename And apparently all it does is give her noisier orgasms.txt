 Recently, someone in China asked 1,000 women how their sex lives were. Turns out, the girls sleeping with rich men had more orgasms. The implication was that the richer they were, the bigger, fuller, deeper and more extravagant their comings became. In fact, anyone considering sharing a knee-trembler with Lakshmi Mittal might take the precaution of having their heart checked out first.
I had to ask: wouldn’t a very, very rich man be pissed off by a girl who took no interest in his financial achievement or thought that the fruit of 70% of his life was unimportant and boring? If you claim that shared values are the secret of a happy marriage, an unswerving belief in the goodness of cash and faith in luxury labels and entitlement can lead to a long, happy and vacuous relationship. Isn’t this, after all, what’s kept Europe’s royal families so entranced with each other for 1,000 years?
So, on balance, is money a help or a hindrance to a happy life? “Well…,” Trudy Hill started to say, “it depends on the person and the circumstances.” No, no, this is the crux of Seventy Thirty. Tell me, in your experience. She looked down and to the right. “Mostly it’s a hindrance. It doesn’t do what it promises.”
Money’s promise is that it will do everything, make everything better and best. And apparently all it does is give her noisier orgasms. Most very rich men mind women taking half their cash in divorce settlements because it makes them look like fools. It makes them look like McCartney mugs. I bet most of them would pay far more to be made to look like Ubermenschen.

美国人老要说的一个男人的ｆｉｎａｎｃｉａｌ　ｓｉｔｕａｔｉｏｎ，是一个男人的主体的衍生品？女人要来跟一个男人有共同语言、共同追求和幸福到一起，但她要那一根金钱的盲肠永远拖在你身后，且老要来结算你。
以上的作者并不进入伦理讨论，而只是在格言和警句的模态上来讨论这个问题：夺男人钱的女人，是专门找那些想用钱来拔高自己的主体的男人的；男人可能暗地里在渴求有女人来这样雁过拔毛于他的，因为这是他的光荣和排场的一部分？
