 德勒兹是从英语里借用了千层平原的说法，来给那本大量讨论美国文学的书取名字的。下文的千层平原的意思好象是：在已有的之上再加上好多，有使充足者增其有的意思：
Such a nice-looking woman. The eyes sparkle reassuringly, the cheeks bloom wholesomely, the mouth smiles easily in an outgoing, friendly sort of way. The face does not have Diana's coy allure, but is commonsensically pretty. She clearly has the inner stability and strength for a future queen, not a ”people's princess” but rather a potential icon of bourgeois monarchy.
There you are. It is the best I can do. Another royal bride has launched a thousand platitudes on the rolling surf of celebrity. What can we poor commentators do? The nation apparently craves comment. Kate Middleton's face is more than a window on a soul, it is a window on the self-absorption of an entire people. It must stand proxy for biography, phrenology, psychology, gossip and sex. The face must tell all when so much is concealed. The one feature of the fiancee of a sometime king that they cannot censor or spin is her face. Age can wither it and custom stale its limited variety, but for the time being it is the one thing about her that is vulnerable and naked to the world. It is all we have to go on.

脸是这样的一种千层平原，所有的一切之上再加上这种在人与人的关系中无价的东西：脸颊会健康地发红，眼睛是会很可靠地你闪，嘴用那一种很套近乎的方式对你笑：但这只是资产阶级之笑，不是高贵的什么的笑：
