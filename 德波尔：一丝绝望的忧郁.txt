 Baltasar Gracian, that great connoisseur of historical time, tells us with much pertinency in El Oraculo manual y Arte de Prudencia: ”Governing, discoursing, everything must be done with purpose. Love when you can, because neither the season nor time wait for anyone.”[60]
But Omar Khayyam was less of an optimist. ”So as to speak clearly and without parables -- We are the pieces of the game that plays the sky; -- We amuse ourselves with ourselves on the chessboard of Being, -- and then we are returned, one by one, to the box of Nothingness.”（《回评》，31）。
