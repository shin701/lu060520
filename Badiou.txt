 Love weaves within its singular duration these four functions: wandering, immobility, imperative, and story.
Beckett formulates the Idea of the sexes, of the two sexes, by combining these four functions, always under the assumption that the event of love has taken place. He thus establishes the masculine and feminine polarities of the Two independently of any empirical or biological determination of the sexes.
The functions combined within the masculine polarity are those of immobility and the imperative. A “man” is one who remains motionless in love by retaining the name that founds it and by prescribing the law of continuity. Yet, because the narrative function is missing, this prescriptive immobility remains mute. In the case of love, a “man” is the name’s silent custodian. And because the function of wandering is missing, to be a “man” is also to do nothing that bears witness to this love, but only to retain, motionless in the dark, its powerful abstract conviction. 
The feminine polarity combines wandering and narrative. It concurs not with the fixity of the name, but with the infinity of its unfolding in the world, in the narrative of its unending glory. It does not stick to the sole prescription without proof, but organizes the constant inquiry and verification of a capacity. To be a “woman,” in the context of love, is to move about under the custody of meaning, rather than of names. This protective effort implies the wayward fate of inquiries, as well as its perpetual recounting in a story.
Love exists as the determination of this polarity, which “supports” the four functions and distributes them individually. This is why love alone calls for the observation that there is indeed “man” (immobility of the imperative, the guarding of the name) and “woman” (wandering of a truth, consequences of the name within speech). Without love, nothing would bear witness to the Two of the sexes. Instead there would be One, and then again One, but not Two. There would not be man “and” woman.
Existence of that sort of “and”, existence of lovers, is the setting of what Beckett quite rightly calls happiness. Happiness also distinguishes the process of love, for happiness can only exist in love. In the case of happiness the void of being is captured in the between-the-Two, in that which constitutes the effective character of the Two, and which is its separation, that is to say, the difference of the sexes as such. Happiness is not in the least associated with the One — the myth of fusion. It is rather the subjective indicator of a truth of difference, of sexual difference, that love alone makes effective.
