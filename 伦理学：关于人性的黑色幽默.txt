伦理学：关于人性的黑色幽默
=============================

 常偷偷读一下哲学家（伦理学）Peter Singer的东西，其文章一般以关于人性的黑色幽默来结束，很对我的胃口。最近读过他的两篇：
1-《敬拜于黛安娜王妃庙》：
That remark may have been a bitter payback for the role Spencer believed the media, and the paparazzi who worked for them, had played in Diana’s death, but it was not without a grain of truth. Some people use cynicism about morality as an excuse for not trying to be a better person. If you can convince yourself that everyone is really only looking out for themselves then you don’t have to feel bad about doing the same. A princess with a nave but sincere desire to do good threatens that protective shell, and one way to blunt the threat is to sneer. Diana might have had a better life in the United States, where people and the media are less cynical about doing good, and more ready to accept good intentions at face value.
If people need to have gods, then, Diana isn’t a bad one to have. She did try in her own way to do some good in the world, and that isn’t a poor example to set. Plus, there seems little danger that a Temple of Diana would try to impose on its adherents a repressive morality that made them feel guilty about sex. 
2-《你为什么要去投票？》：
But there are many possible reasons for voting. Some people vote because they enjoy it, and would have nothing better to do with the time saved if they did not. Others are motivated by a sense of civic duty that does not assess the rationality of voting in terms of the possible impact of one’s own ballot.
Still others might vote not because they imagine that they will determine the outcome of the election, but because, like football fans, they want to cheer their team on. They may vote because if they don’t, they will be in no position to complain if they don’t like the government that is elected. Or they may calculate that while the chances of their determining the outcome are only one in several million, the result is of such importance that even that tiny chance is enough to outweigh the minor inconveniences of voting.
If these considerations fail to get people to the polls, however, compulsory voting is one way of overcoming the free-rider problem. The small cost imposed on not voting makes it rational for everyone to vote and at the same time establishes a social norm of voting. Australians want to be coerced into voting. They are happy to vote, knowing that everyone else is voting, too. Countries worried about low voter turnout would do well to consider their compulsory model.
