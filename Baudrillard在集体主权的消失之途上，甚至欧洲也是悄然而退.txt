 ...The return of the ”yes” later was only the mark of an inexorable normalization. Only the ”no” remains a mystery. This ”no” is certainly not the one pronounced by its official supporters, since their political arguments are as inconsistent as those advanced by the supporters of the ”yes” vote. In any case, a politically inspired ”no” would never have been able to set the opinion polls on fire, and it is precisely this political ”no” that slowly seems to be receding under the pressure of the return of the ”yes.” 
The most interesting thing, the only enthralling thing in this trompe l'oeil referendum is the ”no” that hides itself behind the official ”no,” the ”no” that is beyond political reason. It is this particular ”no” that marks a resistance. And there must be something quite dangerous about it that can explain why all the energies and powers mobilized for the defense of the ”yes” have to rally against it. Such a panic conjuration is really the sign that there's a dead body inside the closet. 
...No matter what the result is, stuck between a ”yes” and a ”no” vote that is similar to the 0-1 binary of numerical calculations, this referendum is rather an unremarkable event.[6] Even Europe is an unremarkable event on the way to a more serious outcome, that of the disappearance of collective sovereignty. And we can start to see the formation of a typology other than that of the passive or even manipulated citizen with now the image of the hostage-citizen, of the citizen hijacked by those in power. Hostage taking has become the very form of terrorism today, a democratic form of state terrorism（“Divine Europe”）.
