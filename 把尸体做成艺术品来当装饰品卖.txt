 Dr Death's body art for the home — if you have the stomach for ithttp://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3307869.ece
His touring Body Worlds exhibitions of preserved corpses manipulated into everyday poses — running, playing chess, cradling a glass of whisky, riding a bicycle — have been seen by more than 20 million visitors.

The doctor now plans to sell 150,000 body parts privately, not just to universities or clinics. “A collection of 16 transparent horizontal slices of a human (head, neck, torso, extremities) Standard quality (fragile):  1,400,” says the price list. “Robust quality (unbreakable):  2,800.”
So far he has been promised 8,568 corpses and has 531 in stock, all swimming in baths of alcohol awaiting his chemical treatment.
