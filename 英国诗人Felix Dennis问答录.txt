英国诗人Felix Dennis问答录
=============================
发布时间：2010-05-09 00:04
 What is the most important lesson life has taught you? 
Fear nothing — failing that, fake it!
How would you like to be remembered? 
Truly, I could not care less.
How often do you have sex? 
Like most people with too much money, as often as I like.
What or who is the greatest love of your life? 
The English language; my woods in springtime（我无法用汉语说出这个意思，我不敢说？汉语不让我说？“我那片地”，这里面有我多少的痛！！）; a certain lady; the getting of money（弄钱之弄）.
