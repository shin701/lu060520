 这是一个美国人关于工党领袖将如何与美国党派接轨的看法,对左,右和自由派之划分大致明确:
For the love of...
British subjects: I wish to provide you with a small lesson in current American politics.
In general:
Democrat = Liberal (social, fiscal, etc)
Republican = Conservative (social only...their spending habits rival and sometimes dwarf the other party)
NeoCons = ??? They certainly don't follow ”conservativism” all that closely.
President Bush is a Republican. Even with such party affiliation and the reputation of being a ”compassionate conservative”, for the most part, he is NOT conservative and, therefore, not extremely ”Republican”.
If you read the article closely, you would notice the following things in the 5 points (I list them by the article's numbers):
1) LBJ and JFK, both were Presidents from the Democratic party.
2) NeoCons - note the reference above.
3) Holidays in Cape Cod - This location is well known throughout the WORLD as a haven for the rich and famous...and populated mostly by DEMOCRATS
4) ”Brown has a network of contacts in the Democratic Party that easily rivals Blair.” - notice the Party affiliation in this sentence?
5) ”He initiated the links with the Clinton team.” - hmmm, ”the Clinton team”...yes, folks, another DEMOCRATIC President.
So, here's the score:
4 of 5 points reference Democrats
1 of 5 points reference ”NeoCons”
Basically, Mr. Brown appears to this American as though, if he were an American, he would be a DEMOCRAT! (and, therefore, Liberal)
In the interest of full disclosure: I am a registered Independant. I am generally 'conservative' in my approach to most things in life. I do hold some 'liberal' positions.
