 他说国家特务机关并不是用高级密码来隐藏真相，而是用日常新闻标题之类来保密的。你其实是随便能进去的，只是你不肯弄醒你的鼻子。黑客是人民派去的复仇者，用真相羞辱了从普京到贝鲁斯科尼等政治大佬，是顺理成章，因为独裁和专制者和已成为全球邪恶帝国的从纽约到巴黎的景观国家装置的看门狗们有相当的愚蠢，认为自己瞒住了人们。但他们不知道，这只瞒住了他们自己，他们不知道他们在人民面前其实是始终穿着开裆裤的。
公民完全有权揭露任何的G家J密，不是因为我们要偷看，而是我们受不了统治者的愚蠢对我们的侮辱。
国家作为一个装置，只是一个将我们自己的身体夹住的山上的野猪套那样的东西了。它的一点丑闻，是唯一让你能围着它不肯离开的原因了。国家现在甚至不要脸到说：你还是要我的好，否则我的秘密警察要乱搞起来， 你们会受不了的，所以，你还是无论如何忍受着我吧。
世界各地的国王们正在被网络剥光，面对他们的恐惧的尖叫，我们只有冷笑。 
As Simon Jenkins put it recently in the Guardian, ”Disclosure is messy and tests moral and legal boundaries. It is often irresponsible and usually embarrassing. But it is all that is left when regulation does nothing, politicians are cowed, lawyers fall silent and audit is polluted. Accountability can only default to disclosure.” What we are hearing from the enraged officialdom of our democracies is mostly the petulant screaming of emperors whose clothes have been shredded by the net.
Which brings us back to the larger significance of this controversy. The political elites of western democracies have discovered that the internet can be a thorn not just in the side of authoritarian regimes, but in their sides too. It has been comical watching them and their agencies stomp about the net like maddened, half-blind giants trying to whack a mole. It has been deeply worrying to watch terrified internet companies – with the exception of Twitter, so far – bending to their will.
But politicians now face an agonising dilemma. The old, mole-whacking approach won't work. WikiLeaks does not depend only on web technology. Thousands of copies of those secret cables – and probably of much else besides – are out there, distributed by peer-to-peer technologies like BitTorrent. Our rulers have a choice to make: either they learn to live in a WikiLeakable world, with all that implies in terms of their future behaviour; or they shut down the internet. Over to them.
