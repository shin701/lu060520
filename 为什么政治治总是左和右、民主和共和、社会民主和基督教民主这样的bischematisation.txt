为什么政治治总是左和右、民主和共和、社会民主和基督教民主这样的bischematisation?

 著名的宪 政专家（从当前的政治新闻里来谈宪 政原理）这样的观察，应放到卢曼的政治社会学里来看：
Modern democracies love duopoly. They flirt with third parties and maverick candidates, but in the out-turn they prefer a clean choice: Democrat/Republican, Christian Democrat/Social Democrat, left and right.
华南虎照事件和ATM机取款被重刑事件，民众这么关注，就是要在这样的事件中来区分出distinctions来。这是一种公民的自我政治教育。
是的，每一个人的政治都是这样从中自学的。从这样的两分中来看清。政治过程就是要去帮助这种澄清，去一再撇清。
总是两大党盘踞一国政治，第二第三反对党的任务是：
 Labour's core ideology was socialism, and it has been found wanting and abandoned. Conservatism's core ideology is basically ”every man for himself, and God help the hindmost”. Cameron tries to conceal that, of course, but while he knows a lot about marketing he is plainly no ideologue. There is, as Nick Clegg senses and strives to say, an abandoned wasteland of progressive politics centred on the liberal values that are at the heart of British politics. It is because the two larger parties have cynically abandoned their ideologies to reduce politics to the level of competitive marketing that so many voters have turned away, complaining that ”politicians are all the same”. The LibDems task, therefore, is to shout out and prove that they are different - by holding to their core ideology and their principles! That is Clegg's job now.
