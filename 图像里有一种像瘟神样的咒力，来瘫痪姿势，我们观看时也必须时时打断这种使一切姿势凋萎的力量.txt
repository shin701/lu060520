 哪怕是《蒙娜丽莎》也只是一部遗失的电影里的一个截面图而已，必须找回那部电影，才能恢复其意义。这就好像是图像里有一种像瘟神样的咒力，使其中的姿势瘫痪，我们面对名画，也必须时时打断这种使一切姿势凋萎的力量。我们的观看是要去激活这种姿势。好像全部的艺术都在呼唤我们要将其中的图像解放为姿势。哲学在古希腊人看来也是这样：它是一个ideas的星丛，我们是在其中将各种现象安排为姿势。电影更容易做到这一点。这就是贝克特会将电影看作姿势之梦的道理（阿甘本《手段多了，目的却找不到了》，54-55）。
Every image, in fact, is animated by an antinomic
polarity: on the one hand, images are the reification
and obliteration of a gesture (it is the imago as death
mask or as symbol); on the other hand, they preserve the
dynamis intact (as in Muybridge's snapshots or in any
sports photograph). The former corresponds to the recollection
seized by voluntary memory, while the latter
corresponds to the image flashing in the epiphany of involuntary
memOlY. And while the former lives in magical
isolation, the latter always refers beyond itself to a
whole of which it is a part. Even the Mona Lisa, even Las
Meninas could be seen not as immovable and eternal
forms, but as fragments of a gesture or as stills of a lostfilm wherein only they would regain their true meaning.
And that is so because a certain kind of litigatio, a paralyzing
power whose spell we need to break, is continuously
at work in every image; it is as if a silent invocation
calling for the liberation of the image into gesture
arose from the entire history of art. This is what in ancient
Greece was expressed by the legends in which statues
break the ties holding them and begin to move. But
this is also the intention that philosophy entrusts to the
idea, which is not at all an immobile archetype as common
interpretations would have it, but rather a constellation
in which phenomena arrange themselves in a gesture.
Cinema leads images back to the homeland
of gesture. According to the beautiful definition implicit
in Beckett's Traum und Nacht, it is tbe dream of a gesture.
The duty of the director is to introduce into this
dream the element of awakening.
