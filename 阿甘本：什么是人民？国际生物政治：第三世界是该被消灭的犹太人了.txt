阿甘本：什么是人民？国际生物政治：第三世界是该被消灭的犹太人了

 Paraphrasing the Freudian postulate on the
relation between Es and feh, one might say that modern
biopolitics is supported by the principle according to
which ”where there is naked life, there has to be a PeopIe,”
as long as one adds immediately that this principle
is valid also in its inverse formulation, which prescribes
that ”where there is a People, there shall be naked life.”
The fracture that was believed to have been healed by
eliminating the people namely, the Jews, who are its
symbol-reproduced itself anew, thereby turning the
whole German people into sacred life that is doomed to
death and into a biological body that has to be infinitely
purified (by eliminating the mentally ill and the carriers
of hereditary diseases). And today, in a different and yet
analogous way, the capitalistic-democratic plan to eliminate
the poor not only reproduces inside itself the people
of the excluded but also turns all the populations of
the Third World into naked life. Only a politics that has
been able to come to terms with the fundamental biopolitical
split of the West will be able to arrest this oscillation
and put an end to the civil war that divides the peoples
and the cities of the Earth.
(1995)
