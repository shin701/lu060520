 But are teenage girls really as ill-adapted to processing these messages as adults think? Recently, I watched a Mediabox-funded short-film project called My Generation, directed by and featuring 15-year-olds, who discuss all the teen issues that so intrigue their elders. What emerges is a generation (though, in the case of the film-makers, an overwhelmingly urban, middle-class one) surprisingly well prepared to manage the barrage of consumer choice, celebrity iconography and mixed messages about how to live and love.
My favourite new friend is a girl called Diana Keisha-Marie. Diana, 18, is smart, confident and expertly dressed. There is almost a generation between us, but it turns out she knows as much about the nuances of being a female in 2007 as I do. According to Diana, these nuances boil down to one thing: you have a brain and a body, and, in this world, it is acceptable to use both; but the way you choose to use them, and in what proportion, will determine where you end up.
