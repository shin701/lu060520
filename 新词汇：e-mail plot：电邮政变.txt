 议会政治：内阁里，第一部长搞不定了：
The departure of such a talented minister in a crucial reforming role raised immediate questions over whether other ministers would follow, and whether Mr Brown had the authority to complete his Cabinet reshuffle.
Earlier in the evening, No 10 appeared reasonably confident that he could delay his reshuffle until Monday rather than rush it out today. There were signs that the e-mail plot to oust him was stalling and Caroline Flint, the Europe Minister, had let it be known that she would back Mr Brown.
But Mr Purnell’s resignation, far more damaging and unexpected than those of Jacqui Smith and Hazel Blears, may give Mr Brown’s critics the courage to make a final strike.
Several Labour MPs, including Graham Allen and Nick Raynsford, seized the moment to call on Mr Brown to resign. Mr Allen, one of the organisers of the e-mail plot, said that he hoped that Mr Brown would take the honourable way out and that the party would move decisively to replace him.
David Cameron reiterated his call for a general election.
