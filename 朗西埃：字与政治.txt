 For it is not by describing that words acquire
their power: it is by naming, by calling, by commanding, by intriguing, by
seducing that they slice into the naturalness of existences, set humans on
their path, separate them and unite them into communities. The word has
many other things to imitate besides its meaning or its referent: the power
of speech that brings it into existence, the movement of life, the gestures of
an oration, the effect it anticipates, the addressee whose listening or reading
it mimics beforehand: ”Take, read!”, ”Reader, throwaway this book.” (《字的肉》，3)
