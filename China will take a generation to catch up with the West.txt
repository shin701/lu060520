China will take a generation to catch up with the West

2045年中国赶上美国？道路曲折。可是，赶上了又有什么意思呢？那时，我们过上一种比现在的美国更好的一点点生活？
不是这样说话的。如果这样去看我们自己的命运，我们还不如早点去死好。
我们的未来如尼采说，必须是创造的，是我们对下一代人的交托，强婴般的光明的创造，才是我们的希望。如果将我们的真未来寄于那种自作聪明的算计，那种资产阶级烂经济学，那我们只配被那个装置奴役。
据此，我认为以下对中国未来的看似精明和清晰的算计，仍是没意思的：
China is still a poor country. Notwithstanding the complexities of measurement, income per head, according to the World Bank, is roughly $3,000, a little less than Jordan and Tunisia.
In the extreme scenario in which US income per head remains the same forever more, and China’s income per head grows by a constant 8 per cent a year, convergence would happen in 2045. But this is silly maths.
The US will not stand still and China’s economic path is likely to be punctured sooner or later by a credit or asset crisis.
Further, it cannot grow by 8 per cent a year for that much longer, not least for demographic reasons. China is the fastest-ageing nation on Earth, with an age structure rather like that of Germany.
Its labour force will begin to decline in 2010 or so and fall every year for the foreseeable future. For a while, the transfer of the 80 million rural migrant pool to higher-productivity urban jobs will mask much of this impact, but only for a few years.
By 2040-50, China will have more people aged over 65 than the entire predicted population of the US. In fact, on every demographic measure, China will be worse off than the US by the middle of the decade.
Moreover, large domestic imbalances, recognised by China’s leaders, reside in large gaps between rural and urban incomes and living standards, an exaggerated heavy industry sector that generates huge undistributed profits and savings, and a consumption share of GDP that is a mere 35 per cent. They reflect the prioritisation of coastal province export and heavy industry development over the countryside, which still accounts for two thirds of total employment.
However, it will take a generation, rather than a decade or two, if at all, to cross the barriers of financial instability, structural change, inadequate institutions, ageing and the highest levels of technological innovation.
By 2030, China will still be a relatively poor country and we cannot know how, or even if, her external and internal contradictions will be resolved, or what the social consequences might be.
A shift in global power is occurring glacially, but is a long way short of the kind that occupies the feverish commentary around the world. Best to keep taking the tablets.
