 政治就是战争.巴利巴这样来理解毛泽东西的”人民战争”思想:Mao’s difficulty, or the difficulty we read in Mao with hindsight, drawing some lessons from the history of the Chinese revolution itself, comes from the fact that the immanent power of the organization which, from the inside, transforms a people into an army, or a “popular army” with a class ideology, in given historical circumstances; namely the revolutionary party, can completely perform the strategic reversal and remain a political agency only at the condition of becoming a state itself (even if a State periodically destructed and reconstructed by revolutionary episodes, in the Maoist vision which led to, or was taught, during the “Cultural revolution”). The only thinkable alternative – very unlikely in the circumstances of war of national liberation – would be that it refrained from “taking power”, or carrying on the revolutionary war until the ‘final” goal (Zweck); which is the complete destruction of the enemy – thus somehow “scaling down” the war from “absolute” to “limited”(2006).
最好的状态是人民之间象施米特说的那样达到内战之白热化,而是最好的政治.次之则是人民战争式的达到人民变成国家再进行文化大革命,夺权夺权再夺权,等到没权可夺,人民真的变成国家.
每一个主体都是 摇摆于主权与动乱之间,个人之间的思想斗争的激烈程度与一国之内的真政治之激烈程度相等.
