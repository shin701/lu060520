韦伯《以学术为职业》笔记
=============================

 向往和孤独地孜孜以求，决不算什么。我们需要达到时代对我们的要求，不光是在我们的学术职业方面，还要在人与人的关系方面。不过，如果我们能找到和服从掌握着我们的生活和生命的纤维的那个“魔鬼”，这是明直和简单的。
From this we want to draw the lesson that nothing is gained by yearning and tarrying alone, and we shall act differently. We shall set to work and meet the 'demands of the day,' in human relations as well as in our vocation. This, however, is plain and simple, if each finds and obeys the demon who holds the fibers of his very life
如果你没有勇气来说清你的最终立场，而是用一些软软的相对的判来搪塞这种责任，那还是不要来做学术的好！
if one lacks the courage to clarify one's own ultimate standpoint and rather facilitates this duty by feeble relative judgments.
If there is no such man, or if his message is no longer believed in, then you will certainly not compel him to appear on this earth by having thousands of professors, as privileged hirelings of the state, attempt as petty prophets in their lecture-rooms to take over his role. All they will accomplish is to show that they are unaware of the decisive state of affairs: the prophet for whom so many of our younger generation yearn simply does not exist. But this knowledge in its forceful significance has never become vital for them. The inward interest of a truly religiously 'musical' man can never be served by veiling to him and to others the fundamental fact that he is destined to live in a godless and prophetless time by giving him the ersatz of armchair prophecy.
To affirm the value of science is a presupposition for teaching there. I personally by my very work answer in the affirmative, and I also do so from precisely the standpoint that hates intellectualism as the worst devil, as youth does today, or usually only fancies it does.
科学只不过是如此:在各种学科内被组织起来的”职业”,是要澄清和理解各种相关的事实.这不是伟大的洞庭湖见者和预言家分发神圣的价值和深知,也不是伟大智者和哲学家对宇宙的意义的沉思:Science today is a 'vocation' organized in special disciplines in the service of self-clarification and knowledge of interrelated facts. It is not the gift of grace of seers and prophets dispensing sacred values and revelations, nor does it partake of the contemplation of sages and philosophers about the meaning of the universe. This, to be sure, is the inescapable condition of our historical situation
