这文章说治通胀的政治后果，是会让政府吃不消；政府会由此做出一些只为自己，不为大家着想的事儿：
The policies required to deal with inflation are, by contrast, always painful and unpopular - raising interest and taxes; cutting government spending and curbing public employees' pay. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that only one country in the world - Japan - has faced a serious deflation problem since the 1930s, while inflation crises have afflicted every market economy in the postwar era and have triggered almost every big recession since 1945. The question, now that the focus of attention is moving beyond the credit crunch, is whether this sad history is likely to repeat itself in the year or two ahead.
The answer depends largely on how governments and central banks worldwide respond to the oil shock. The challenge most discussed in recent weeks is the one facing central banks. If the surge in oil prices causes accelerating pay growth and then a second round of price rises in goods and services not directly exposed to oil, central banks will face stark alternatives: either deliberately to create recessions and mass unemployment by raising interest rates even amid the present property slump, or to accept 1970s-style wage-price spirals, which will have to be cured eventually with even deeper recessions, higher unemployment and greater financial grief.
