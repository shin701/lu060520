 The UK economy is slowing rapidly, depressed by the global credit crunch, declining house prices and the collapse of construction. The household sector has overborrowed quite recklessly, partly in the expectation of ever rising house prices. The UK as a whole is worse off because its exports now buy fewer imports of oil, gas and other commodities. Restoring a sustainable financial position when inflation is running ahead of average earnings growth will mean belt-tightening for many households.
There is nothing that the Bank of England can do to diminish the pain of adjusting to the increase in the relative price of commodities or to the need to restore sustainable household finances. The Government can only redistribute the burden of adjustment, and every day we see interest groups - such as lorry drivers or people living in rural areas who drive a lot - wanting to pass their share of that burden on to the rest of the community。
政府只能 对通货膨胀的调整压力挪腾地方，分配负担，于是，我们每天看到不同的利益集团出 来闹，要将这种压力、负担和痛苦转嫁到其集的利益集团上。于是，经济问题成不政治问题。
