It is a matter of putting an end to the hegemony of aristocrats and warriors, of
“squires and damsels” on the stage (as well as, for quite some time, in reality).
Theatre must guarantee the popular triumph of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Of
course, we keep the music, we keep the resources of the plot, we keep the good
and bad emotions, in reality we keep everything, but for the princes we substitute
the heroes of the people’s war. It is almost a simple costume change. Well, the
affair brought about ten years of bloody tumultuousness; shady political episodes
will shake China from the smallest factory in the provinces all the way to the
Polit=buro; and in the end—surprise!—it will fail. Mao wasn’t even dead yet when
it failed: squires and damsels were back on the stage, much to the relief of Deng
Xiaoping, who used to be bored to death by the operas “with a contemporary
revolutionary theme.” To purge theatre of its traditional heroes—kings,
princesses, courtesans, elegant ladies and dandies, maids and soothsayers: they are
the same everywhere, the affair has nothing particularly Chinese to it—was not
within the power of the historical leader of the revolution, not even when
supported by twenty million Red Guards, worker factions, and a few army
units. Nobody can take the theatre by assault. Theatre is more solidly statelike than
the State itself
