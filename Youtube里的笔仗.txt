 这里是一个人说Gould弹得好，一个说他弹得不好，于是就是这样的泥仗：语言倒是很有意思，用了短信风格：

((GG won't (CAN'T) reinvent himself 2 conform Ur private tastes (2 which U have Every Right of course)... this man is happpily... D E A D ))另一个人说：
hi shareman,
let's call it quits.
I suppose U R good enough a (hu)man

((you should be open to the possibility
that Glenn Gould is REVERED for Good
Reasons (just as Elvis is ;) ) !!! ))
