波利雅尔：权力的地狱
=============================

 Henceforth, we are concerned with the exercise of power in its pure state, without bothering about sovereignty or representation, the integral reality of a negative power. As long as it draws its sovereignty from representation, as long as political reason exists, power can find its equilibrium -- in any case it can be challenged and contested. But the erasure of that sovereignty leaves power unchecked, without counterpart, wild (with savagery no longer natural, but technical). And, by a strange twist of fate, it recovers something from primitive societies, which, according to Claude Lévi-Strauss, lacked history because they knew nothing about power. What if our present global society, basking in the shadow of this integral power, was again becoming a society without history?But this integral reality of power is also its end. A power that is only founded on prevention and the policing of events, which has no other political will than to brush specters aside, in turn becomes spectral and vulnerable. Its virtual power is total, its power to program everything in terms of software, indexes, packages, etc., but suddenly it can no longer take any chances, except at its own expense, through all kinds of internal weaknesses. At the height of its mastery, it can no longer lose face. Such is, literally, the ”Hell of Power.”
