我们时代的四种与/对世界的关系/态度
=============================

 This stance has to be located within the matrix of the four possible relations
between the two terms. Subjectivist idealists claim that we made our world
and can therefore also fully grasp it, since in comprehending it, we discern in
it the traces of our own activity. Scientifi c materialists in the Enlightenment
vein claim that although we did not make this world, although this world is
an objective reality with its own independent laws, we can nonetheless understand
it, and control and master it. Ecologists mostly share the premise of
our fi nitude: we did not create our world, we are thrown into it, so we should
respect it, not merely try to dominate it.
There is, however, a fourth position, rarely mentioned and the most difficult
to properly understand: we created our world, but it overwhelms us, we cannot
grasp and control it. This position is like that of God when he confronts Job
toward the end of the book of Job: a God who is himself overwhelmed by his
own creation. This is what dialectics is about: what eludes the subject’s grasp
is not the complexity of transcendent reality, but the way the subject’s own activity is
inscribed into reality（《齐泽克：基督教的骇人之处》，244）.
