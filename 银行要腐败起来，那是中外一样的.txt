银行要腐败起来，那是中外一样的

 In China, ventures may be spectacularly unprofitable, yet enrich everyone lucky enough to get a piece. Developers, for example, construct vacant office buildings as an excuse to borrow from state banks. They rake off a cut for themselves, pay bribes to the party officials who deliver the land and reward bank functionaries with sumptuous banquets and trips to Macao. Soon enough, the trophy skyscraper descends into financial disaster, but the developers, bankers and party officials have already extracted their riches, and for long afterward they will still enjoy them.
Much the same can be said of Countrywide, the mortgage lender that sold itself to Bank of America last year in a fire sale, after many of its loans went bad. Shareholders were mostly wiped out. Homeowners suffered foreclosure. But the company’s executives made out brilliantly, cashing stock options amassed during the real estate boom, when Countrywide’s share price soared along with its loan volume. Ditto the Wall Street bankers who enabled Countrywide to lend with abandon by selling their mortgages to investors.
