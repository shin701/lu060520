布莱希特：赞美共产主义：它太简单，所以难了
=============================

 It's sensible, anyone can understand it.
It's easy.
You're not an exploiter, so you can grasp it.
It's a good thing for you,
find out more about it.
The stupid call it stupid and the squalid call it squalid.
It's against squalor and against stupidity.
The exploiters call it a crime but we know:
It is the end of crime
It is not madness, but the end of madness.
It is not the riddle but the solution
It is the simplest thing so hard to achieve.
Bertolt Brecht.
