诗学从一开始就是政治的
=============================

 The enduring lesson of
Platonic conceptualization is this: there is no pure poetics. Poetry is an art
of composing fables that represent characters and act upon characters. It
thus belongs to a political experience of the physical: to the relationship between
the nomoi of the city-the laws that reign there, but also the songs
that are sung-and the ethos of the citizens-their character, but also their
humor. Poetics is from the beginning political. It is so by the conjunction
between a certain type of individual that should or should not be imitated
and a certain place of utterance that is or is not suitable to what must be the
tone of the city.
We see now why the lyric poem does not have to be specified within this
schema. The poetic forms in it can be made out and examined as they link
a certain kind of lexis to a certain kind of representation. The place of lyricism
is an empty place in this schema, that of un-signifYing poetry, inoffensive
because it is non-representational and because it does not pose or hide
any distancing between the poet-subject and the subject of the poem. The
unambiguous ”I” of the lyric poem cannot pose a problem to the ”we” of the
mrnuniry; whereas tragedy splits it in two by the deception of the lexis,
:1I1d the epic corrupts it by the falsification of the muthos. Good poetry is
equivalent to a non-poetry that does not fabricate any lie and does not divide
