 现实起来越成为the Real，后者说到底，也只是DNA的结构了，这个之外，其它全部可以再造：
 In so far as the VR apparatus is potentially able to generate experience of
the 'true' reality, VR undermines the difference between ,true' reality and
semblance. This 'loss of reality' occurs not only in computer-generated VR but,
at a more elementary level, already with the growing 'hyperrealism' of the images
with which the media bombard us - more and more, we perceive only colour and
outline, no longer depth and volume: 'Without visual limit there can be no, or
almost no, mental imagery; without a certain blindness, no tenable appearance.'8
Or - as Lacan put it - without a blind spot in the field of vision, without this
elusive point from which the object returns the gaze, we no longer 'see
something'; the field of vision is reduced to a flat surface, and 'reality' itself is
perceived as a visual hallucination.
 The MUD (Multiple User Domains) technology in cyberspace undermines
the notion of Self, or the self-identity of the perceiving subject: the standard
motif of 'postmodern' writers on cyberspace, from Stone9 to Turkle, is that
cyberspace phenomena like MUD render the deconstructionist 'decentred
subject' palpable in our everyday experience. The lesson is that one should
endorse this 'dissemination' of the unique Self into a multiplicity of competing
agents, into a 'collective mind', a plurality of self-images without a global coordinating
centre, and disconnect it from pathological trauma: playing in Virtual
Spaces enables me to discover new aspects of 'me', a wealth of shifting identities,
of masks without a 'real' person behind them, and thus to experience the
ideological mechanism of the production of Self, the immanent violence and
arbitrariness of this production/construction.
