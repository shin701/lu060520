斯特劳斯：《神话和意义》：我是没有“我”的
=============================

 I never had, and still do not have, the perception of feeling my personal identity. I
appear to myself as the place where something is going on, but there is no ‘I’, no ‘me.’
Each of us is a kind of crossroads where things happen. The crossroads is purely passive;
something happens there. A different thing, equally valid, happens elsewhere. There is no
choice, it is just a matter of chance.
I don’t pretend at all that, because I think that way, I am entitled to conclude that
mankind thinks that way too. But I believe that, for each scholar and each writer, the
particular way he or she thinks and writes opens a new outlook on mankind. And the fact
that I personally have this idiosyncracy perhaps entitles me to point to something which
is valid, while the way in which my colleagues think opens different outlooks, all of
which are equally valid.
