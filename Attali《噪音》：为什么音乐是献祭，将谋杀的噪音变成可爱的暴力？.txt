Attali《噪音》：为什么音乐是献祭，将谋杀的噪音变成可爱的暴力？

 被宰杀的牛羊的尖叫，如何就成为人类过节的喜庆的一部分？人类想象中的阴暗与狂暴，如何被仪式化为音乐的谋杀？“音乐是模仿了人对于宰杀的垄断权，是对仪式性杀戮的模仿”。音乐使听众意识到他们身上的共同性，但同时也挑起观众的反骨，最直捣它的黄龙。
音乐是祭祀和宰杀。听音乐就有点体被杀。听音乐是参加屠杀的仪式，带着全部的危险、罪感，但也被保证免死。
但音乐时代成了买卖的商品，是可买和可卖的权力。我们一声不响地坐着听音乐时，就像是成了木偶、雕像和僵尸一样。音乐是我们对于自己身上和想象中的可怕噪音的仪式性的优美回应。我们原来是人人会音乐和舞蹈的，但是，现在，我们就像是跳着舞，却发现音乐突然找不见了。我们还想跳舞台，但我们的双腿像一把锈蚀的剪刀了（阿塔利《噪音》，28页）。
Music responds to the terror of noise, recreating differences between sounds
and repressing the tragic dimension of lasting dissonance-just as sacrifice responds
to the terror of violence. Music has been, from its origin, a simulacrum
of the monopolization of the power to kill, a simulacrum of ritual murder. A
necessary attribute of power, it has the same form power has: something emitted
from the singular center of an imposed, purely syntactic discourse, a discourse
capable of making its audience conscious of a commonality-but also of turning
its audience against it.
The hypotheses of noise as murder and music as sacrifice are not easy to
accept. They imply that music functions like sacrifice; that listening to noise is
a little like being killed; that listening to music is to attend a ritual murder, with
all the danger, guilt, but also reassurance that goes along with that; that applauding
is a confirmation, after the channelization of the violence, that the spectators
of the sacrifice could potentially resume practicing the essential violence（28）.
