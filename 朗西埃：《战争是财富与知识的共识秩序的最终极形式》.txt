 Technological progress and Capital’s
global domination are thus thought to correspond to ever more modern forms
of the exercise of power: power ever more diluted and imperceptible, as
mobile and invisible as the flux of communication, negotiated like commodities,
exercising its painless effects through a globally accepted way of life. We
call this, depending our temperament, the invisible world government of
capital, triumphant mass democracy, or soft totalitarianism. Under all these
names, we designate a form of government apparently far removed from
military campaigns for law and civilization, hymns to God and flag, and lies
of State propaganda. So how then do we think about this newness that so
strangely resembles the old? This gap between the technological sophistication
of weapons and the crudeness of the forms of manipulation of public opinion?
