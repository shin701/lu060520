 For veteran Zizek-watchers like myself, it was a surprise to see him also take swipes at anarchists and at Noam Chomsky. For Zizek, ”the tragedy of anarchism is that you end up having an authoritarian secret society trying to achieve anarchist goals.” After reading this, I nearly resolved to change my name to Louis Zero and listen to Rage Against the Machine 12 hours a day.
The hostility to Chomsky is another story altogether. Bad Subjects editor Charlie Bertsch sets the tone for this in the introduction to the interview: ” For anyone who has tired of the dumbing down of mainstream political discourse in the West, who finds it hard to believe that the bone-dry American leftism of a Noam Chomsky represents the only possibility for resistance, who wants to critique global capitalism without falling back on faded Marxist slogans, Zizek's work flashes the promise of something better.”
Of course, it must be said that the ”something better” referred to above must be connected to the sort of success that Zizek enjoys in certain circles. For Bertsch, this very well might have more to do with how many times you appear in New Left Review rather than speaking on Pacifica Radio or at a campus teach-in on the war in Afghanistan:
”It's hard to become a superstar in the world of scholarly publishing. Most of the people who read its products can also write them. To stand out in a crowd this smart requires both luck and perseverance. Slavoj Zizek has demonstrated plenty of both.”
Ah, to be a superstar. One would hope that Charlie Bertsch gets a chance to look into Budd Schulberg's ”What Makes Sammy Run” or Norman Podhoretz's ”Making It” to find out how it's really done.
Turning to the interview itself, we discover that the big problem with Chomsky is not just that he doesn't know how to connect Lacan to Peewee Herman. Rather it is that he is too preoccupied with ”facts”. Henwood poses the question to Zizek:
”Chomsky and people like him seem to think that if we just got the facts out there, things would almost take care of themselves. Why is this wrong? Why aren't 'the facts' enough?”
 西方学院左派以为玩玩乔姆斯基就激进了，齐奏泽克认为，乔的将事实弄清，是不够，没意思的，必须有理论进入，拉康是重要的，没有post-theory：
Zizek's reply is extraordinary:
”Let me give you a very naive answer. I think that basically the facts are already known. Let's take Chomsky's analyses of how the CIA intervened in Nicaragua. OK, (he provides) a lot of details, yes, but did I learn anything fundamentally new? It's exactly what I'd expected: the CIA was playing a very dirty game. Of course it's more convincing if you learn the dirty details. But I don't think that we really learned anything dramatically new there. I don't think that merely 'knowing the facts' can really change people's perceptions.”
