 我不喜欢学术，我喜欢读书；我喜欢革命，不喜欢当革命家； 我爱弹钢琴，但我不爱当钢琴家（阿格里希）。1968，文化大革命，我爱闹革命，但不爱真的去革命，最有有个老妈来帮我打扫残局。
拉康：你们红卫兵是歇斯底里患者，你们嚷嚷，是想要有个新的主人来统治你们，你们会得到它的！
在这个liberal-permissive 的消费社会里，会哭的孩子全得到他们想要的了，不要的你准备扔给你了。
我们想要的，叫着要的，不是得不到，而是得到的超地了我们想要的，这不叫吃不了兜着走么？
Lacan provides the answer in L’envers de la psychanalyse, his Seminar XVII (1969-1970) on the four discourses, Lacan's response to the events of 1968 - its premise is best captured as his reversal of the well-known anti-structuralist graffiti from the Paris walls of 1968 ”Structures do not walk on the streets!” - if anything, this Seminar endeavors to demonstrate how structures DO walk on the streets, i.e. how structural shifts CAN account for the social outbursts like that of the 1968. Instead of the one symbolic Order with its set of a priori rules which guarantee social cohesion, we get the matrix of the passages from one to another discourse: Lacan's interest is focused on the passage from the discourse of the Master to the discourse of University as the hegemonic discourse in contemporary society. No wonder that the revolt was located at the universities: as such, it merely signaled the shift to the new forms of domination in which the scientific discourse serves legitimizes the relations of domination. Lacan's underlying premise is skeptic-conservative - Lacan's diagnosis is best captured by his famous retort to the student revolutionaries: ”As hysterics, you demand a new master. You will get it!” This passage can also be conceived in more general terms, as the passage from the prerevolutionary ancien regime to the postrevolutionary new Master who does not want to admit that he is one, but proposes himself as a mere servant of the People — in Nietzsche's terms, it is simply the passage from Master's ethics to slave morality, and this fact, perhaps, enables us a new approach to Nietzsche: when Nietzsche scornfully dismisses slave morality, he is not attacking lower classes as such, but, rather, the new masters who are no longer ready to assume the title of the Master - slave is Nietzsche's term for a fake master. — How, then, more closely, are we to read the university discourse（齐泽克《从政治到生活政治》）?
