 当代，全球人民正在被驱赶到一个单一的共同命运上，因为，记者和新闻像天主教那样，将人们从他们自己的母语和身份中拔出，成为黑压压的诸众。他们的围成一个无名的共同体，会让国家极其恐慌，像在天安门上一样。
语言上的被剥夺，就像他们的生产资料、劳动和人权的被剥夺一样，正在造就新的全球无产阶级。而全球小资产阶级则是撑起全球景观社会的道具（阿甘本《没有目的的手段》，88）。
In the society of the spectacle, in fact, the isolation
of the Shekinah reaches its final phase, in which
language not only constitutes itself as an autonomous
sphere, but also no longer reveals anything at all-or,
better yet, it reveals the nothingness of all things. In language
there is nothing of God, of the world, of the revealed:
but, in this extreme nullifying unveiling, language
(the linguistic nature of human beings) remains once
again hidden and separated. Language thus acquires, for
the last time, the unspoken power to claim a historical
age and a state for itself: the age of the spectacle, or the
estate of fully realized nihilism. This is why today power
founded on a presupposed foundation is vacillating all
around the planet: the kingdoms of the Earth are setting
out, one after the other, for the spectacular-democratic
regime that constitutes the completion of the state-form.
Even more than economic necessities and technological
development, what drives the nations of the Earth toward
a single common destiny is the alienation of linguistic
being, the uprooting of all peoples from tbeir vital
dwelling in language. But exactly for this reason, the
age in which we live is also that in which for the first
time it becomes possible for human beings to experience
their own linguistic essence-to experience, that is, not
some language content or some true proposition, but
language itself, as well as the very fact of speaking. Contemporary
politics is precisely this devastating experimentum
linguae that disarticulates and empties, all over
the planet, traditions and beliefs, ideologies and religions,
identities and communities.
Only those who will be able to carry it to
completion-without allowing that which reveals to be
veiled in the nothingness it reveals, but bringing language
itself to language-will become the first citizcns
of a community with neither presuppositions nor a state.
In this community, the nullifying and determining power
of what is common will be pacified and the Shekinah will
no longer suck the evil milk of its own separateness. Like
Rabbi Akiba in the Haggadah of the Talmud, the citizens
of this community will enter the paradise of language
and will come out of it uninjurc
