She is said to have had more than 200 lovers, some of them younger than her own son. Strikingly beautiful, with amber eyes, dark-brown hair, full breasts and an irrepressible lust for life, Jennie Jerome was irresistible to men. 
Earls, lords, counts, even the randy old Prince Of Wales, the future Edward VII, lusted after her. And she willingly complied. 
When Edward was crowned in 1902, she sat in a special pew in Westminster Abbey, which society wits dubbed 'the loose box' on account of its rather promiscuous occupants. She shared it with half a dozen other royal mistresses, including Alice Keppel and Lillie Langtry. 
Jennie, Winston Churchill's American mother, was very different from her son, who was utterly devoted to one woman: his darling wife, Clemmie. And it is this contrast that makes their relationship - the subject of Lady Randy, a new Channel 4 documentary - so fascinating. 
Her background is extraordinary. Descended quite possibly from an American Indian who had raped a white settler, she was born into a notoriously lascivious family, conceived in Italy and named after a popular singer who was probably one of her father's mistresses. She was possibly pregnant with Winston when she walked up the aisle to marry his father, Lord Randolph Henry Spencer Churchill. 
When Lord Randolph died, apparently of syphilis, her next two marriages were to men more than 20 years her junior, earning her a reputation for vanity and frivolity. 
Despite always being hard up, she was also a shameless spendthrift and wafted around London in the finest Paris gowns, entertaining the smartest trendsetters, courting lovers and sporting a provocative snake tattoo on her wrist. Wherever she went, she was the talk of the town....
