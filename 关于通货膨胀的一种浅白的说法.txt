This is really a stealth tax becuase for each hour work your money buys you less and less.
Given that factories are cutting capacity and the basics like gas, food are all costing more to import it is inevitable that this feeds through the system in the form of higher prices hence inflation.
You only have to look at UK Goverment bond prices to see that higher interest rates are on the way because investors are demanding higher returns to lend to UK.
In a way the Government wants rampant inflation becuase it wants to inflate away its debts. Savers/OAPs/People on Fixed Income will be loosers. Winners will be people with massive debts.
Gold/Oil/Houses are all good hedges against inflation.
