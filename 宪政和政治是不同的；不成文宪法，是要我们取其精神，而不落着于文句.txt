宪政和政治是不同的；不成文宪法，是要我们取其精神，而不落着于文句

 君主立宪法可以更民主是因为，它更受制于时局之具体，直选后更方便地更换领导人：
At this point in the argument Peter Riddell points out that the Monarch chooses the person able to command the Commons; that a general election chooses a Parliament not a prime minister; and that government MPs can take a steer from the unions if they wish. Thus says our unwritten constitution.
But an unwritten constitution is less, and more, than a set of rules understood by the initiated but that nobody has written down. The point of an unwritten constitution is to let the spirit rather than the letter lead the way, and the uninitiated are as qualified as anyone else to grasp the spirit. It is my clear understanding of that spirit - and I think it will be widely shared outside Westminster - that a party leader who was handed the job (in part) by an unelected body is in urgent need of an electoral mandate if, because of that position, he becomes prime minister.
We should leave our parties free to choose their members, their candidates and their leaders in any way that they like. At root they are free associations of volunteers and enthusiasts. We don't have to vote for them, and they can govern themselves as they choose. They, in turn, should accept that when party office translates into public office - the highest in the land - and begins to govern the whole nation, an election is required.

另一个很懂宪政且知道许多先例的人写的：
The real question is political. You can call it either a mandate or an emotional contract (in the words of the marketing men in No 10). That was the case for an election last autumn, and would be even more so if Labour changed its leader this year. Prime ministers who have not won an election lack the personal authority of those who have.
