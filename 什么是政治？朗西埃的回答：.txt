It does so because politics itself is not the exercise of power or struggle for power. Politics is first of all the configuration of a space as political , the framing of a specific sphere of experience , the setting of objects posed as ”common” and of subjects to whom the capacity is recognized to designate these objects and discuss about them. Politics first is the conflict about the very existence of that sphere of experience , the reality of those common objects and the capacity of those subjects（政治首要地是将一种空间定型configurate为“政治的”，是对某一经验领域的框定，是对被设定为“共同的”对象和主体的设定（主体被认为有这样一种能力：指定这些对象客体并讨论它们）。政治首要地是对那一经验领域的存在、那些共同的对象的现实和那些主体的能力之间的冲突）. A well known aristotelian sentence says that human beings are political because they own the power of speech that puts into common the issues of justice and injustice while animals only have voice to express pleasure or pain. It could seem to follow from this that politics is the public discussion on matters of justice among speaking people who are all able to do it（政治是一种会说话的人之间的关于公正的公共讨论）. But there is a preliminary matter of justice : How do you recognize that the person who is mouthing a voice in front of you is discussing matters of justice rather than expressing his or her private pain ? Politics is in fact about that preliminary question : who has the power to decide about this? In another well-known statement Plato says that artisans have no time to be elsewhere outside of their work . Obviously this ”lack of time” is not an empirical matter , it is the mere naturalization of a symbolical separation . Politics precisely begins when they who have ”no time” to do anything else than their work take that time that they have not in order to make themselves visible as sharing in a common world and prove that their mouth indeed emits common speech instead of merely voicing pleasure or pain. That distribution and re-distribution of times and spaces , places and identities , that way of framing and re-framing the visible and the invisible , of telling speech from noise and so on , is what I call the partition of the sensible . Politics consist in reconfigurating the partition of the sensible , in bringing on the stage new objects and subjects , in making visible that which was not visible, audible as speaking beings they who where merely heard as noisy animals （政治是对感性分割的重新布排，是要将新的主体和客体带进当代舞台，使不可见的东西可见，将只被当作动物的噪音来听的声音，成为公共的声音）. To the extent that it sets up such scenes of dissensus , politics can be characterized as an ”aesthetic” activity , in a way that has nothing to do with that adornment of power that Benjamin called ”aestheticization of politics”（就把异见表演出来这一点来说，政治可被看作一种“审美”活动，可以说，这与本雅明所说的“政治的审美化”成为对权力的点缀这一点毫无关系。） .
