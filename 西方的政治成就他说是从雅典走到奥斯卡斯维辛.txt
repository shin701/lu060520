 大众传媒要将我们的身体剔出关于话语的话语的传播，国家治体是要控制我们的生物生命将语言剔出我们的生物生命，两相夹节，我们每一个人都成自己的国家中成为嫌疑犯，都是危险的阶级，越是普通人越像恐怖分子。人类的生物生命本身被国家高度怀疑，用尽一切办法来控制。如福柯说，人是在这样的国家被高度动物化，被当作动物园里的东西来饲养。
所以，阿甘本认为，当代西方或启蒙时代以来的西方政治的基本范式是：集中营；我们这个奥斯维辛之外的集中营更是绵里针式的集中营。西方的政治成就他说是从雅典走到奥斯卡斯维辛：
What is at stake here is nothing less than the new ”normal” bio-political relationship between
citizens and the state. This relation no longer has anything to do with free and active
participation in the public sphere, but concerns the enrollment and the filing away of the
most private and incommunicable aspect of subjectivity: I mean the body’s biological life.
These technological devices that register and identify naked life correspond to the media
devices that control and manipulate public speech: between these two extremes of a body
without words and words without a body, the space we once upon a time called politics is
ever more scaled-down and tiny.
Thus, by applying these techniques and these devices invented for the dangerous classes to a
citizen, or rather to a human being as such, states, which should constitute the precise space
of political life, have made the person the ideal suspect, to the point that it’s humanity itself
that has become the dangerous class.
Some years ago, I had written that the West’s political paradigm was no longer the city state,
but the concentration camp, and that we had passed from Athens to Auschwitz. It was
obviously a philosophical thesis, and not historic recital, because one could not confuse
phenomena that it is proper, on the contrary, to distinguish.
I would have liked to suggest that tattooing at Auschwitz undoubtedly seemed the most
normal and economic way to regulate the enrolment and registration of deported persons into
concentration camps（《对对公民身体的生物政治烙印说不》，《世界报》，2004年1月10日）.
