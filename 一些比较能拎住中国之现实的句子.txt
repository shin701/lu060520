 外国人用另外的语言说不得出，就格外清晰；是他帮我说出，说出了，也就成了我的观察：
The Beijing Olympics were quite a show. But then it's wonderful what you can do with total control over your people：如果你能对人民一手遮天，那么你搞得漂亮又算你什么本事。Put on a show, throw up a couple of impressive buildings and the world is your friend：弄个开幕式，弄出几个建筑来，全世界就都算你是朋友了，哪怕你欺压自己的人民？
 “China has set the bar very high,” Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, said. “There are some things that London will not be able to compare to, or equal - such as the ability to bring hundreds of thousands of volunteers to different sites.” Yes, Jacques, it is amazing what people can achieve once they appreciate there is no alternative. 让老百姓进退无路，那就只能照你要他们做的事来办了，事情就象北京O运会那么漂亮了。
 “The legacy of these Games is ultimately up to the Chinese people,” Rogge added, but that is a lie too. Nothing can be decided by an oppressed people. 被压迫的人民是无法来决定事儿的。
 As a member of Tony Blair's Government, Tessa clearly did not think that it was going too far to accuse an oppressive regime of possessing weapons of mass destruction, bombing it, invading it, and then finding none; but having got on the totalitarian happy pills in Beijing, she knows the pain that a media barb can bring. Worse than collateral damage, that is. 英国的体育官员对中国的高压政策有同情，这是因为：到北京去吃了那一集权主义摇头丸，英国的体育部长更知道自己那儿的媒体的地毯式轰炸的吃不消了。
Of course the Beijing Games went without a hitch. Give anyone total, terrifying control over a population, with force, and they will make them march in unison, drum, smile, dance, mime, jump through hoops if necessary. “They don't look very oppressed,” wrote one observer. No, pal, and neither would you if you knew the consequences of complaint. 只要给你充分的集QZ制，你就能将开幕式搞成那么整齐的！
The Beijing Olympics was China's Triumph of the Will. Immaculately staged, but there is a bit more to it than just choreography. 张艺M的编排艺术，就是Z制之艺术本身啊！从秦始皇到毛泽东到我们现在，就是那点儿东西啊，两者是不分的！这种可怕的choreography使你我有户口，有了我们最能想象出来的城管和黑警、中国男足和张一某。
外国媒体可能总体说不清中国的现实，但如果我们将他们的观察句深入再观察下去，就可以观察到我们的新现实的。
