 就是生怕自己受教育少，拼命逼自己东学西学。而教育是如朗西埃说，是解放心灵，也不需要专家来解放，就只要父亲和另一个人来宣布就行：
the American philosopher Rosenstock-Hussey: “The goal of education is to form the Citizen; and the Citizen is a person who, if need be, can re-found his civilisation.”
Lord Eustace Percy said: “There is always a tendency to devote education to apparently directly utilitarian purposes... but the whole idea and purpose of a liberal education is to liberate the mind.”
演《傲慢与偏见》的女演员Keira Knightley没上过大学，所以总拼命读书，来补一辈子，而她受的大学外的教育不知比学院内的人要多和好不知多少倍：
Keira Knightley, aged 23, has told a magazine that she is “completely uneducated” and that not going to university gave her a chip on her shoulder. “It makes me feel I am going to read absolutely everything so I can prove that I am not stupid.” The poor girl is currently wading through a biography of Albert Speer, a history of the Vietnam War, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Germaine Greer's hoary old Female Eunuch. With dyslexia, too. What a heroine. Meanwhile, innumerable men and women who do have university degrees - and therefore no chips but a sense of quiet 2:1 superiority - will be on the beach happily sinking themselves in moronic chick-lit and Jeremy Clarkson.
You might conclude that it is actually better for your educational morale and motivation to skip university and its three years of squalid quarters, unwise drinking, rising debt, dodgy romances and desultory study. If you don't need a technical specialism and have no real passion for the humanities, hurling yourself into the world might do as well. An actor's life itself is not a bad liberal education: Knightley has been led through the Russian Revolution in Dr Zhivago, considered multiculturalism and sport in Bend it Like Beckham, and entered the worlds of Jane Austen, Dylan Thomas and Second World War nurses. She shortly takes on late Shakespeare as Cordelia. Had she gone into another field - say derivatives trading or being a holiday rep - she could also have learnt things - geographical, economic, scientific - while still gamely plugging away at Speer and Greer in the evenings. It's all a matter of attitude. It could be that the definition of education that Knightley eventually reaches is a higher thing than many graduates can claim.
