 只有一种同时思考国家终结和历史的终结的思考，动员国家的终结来对抗历史的终结或动员历史的终结来对抗国家的终结，才配得上这个时代。这是海德格尔晚期想做而没有做好的事儿。
Only a thought capable of thinking the end
of the state and the end of history at one and the same
time, and of mobilizing one against the other, is equal
to this task. This is what the late Heidegger tried to address-
albeit in an entirely unsatisfactory way-with
the idea of an Ereignis, of an ultimate event in which what
is seized and delivered from historical destiny is the being-
hidden itself of the historical principle, that is, historicity
itself. Simply because history designates the expropriation
itself of human nature through a series of
epochs and historical destinies, it does not follow that the
fulfillment and the appropriation of the historical telos
in question indicate that the historical process of humanity
has now cohered in a definitive order (whose management
can be handed over to a homogeneous universal
state). It indicates, rather, that the anarchic historicity
itself that-having been posited as a presupposition destined living human heings to various epochs and historical cultures must now come to thought as such. It
indicates, in other words, that now human beings take
possession of their own historical being, that is, of their
own impropriety. The becoming-proper (nature) of the
improper (language) cannot be either formalized or recognized
according to the dialectic of Anerkemzung because
it is, at the same time, a becoming-improper (language)
of the proper (nature).
The appropriation of historicity, therefore,
cannot still take a state-form, given that the state is nothing
other than the presupposition and the representation
of the being-hidden of the historical arche. This appropriation,
rather, must open the field to a nonstatal and
nonjuridical politics and human life-a politics and a
life that are yet to be entirely thought.
The concepts of sovereignty and of constituent power,
例外状态成了常规，裸生命成了主权核发的携带者；而在今天，裸生命被抛给了暴力，这种暴力由于无名和日常而更猛烈。
that the state of exception
is the rule, that naked life is immediately the carrier
of the sovereigu nexus, and that, as such, it is today
abandoned to a kind of violence that is all the more effective
for being anonymous and quotidian.
While the state in decline lets its empty shell survive
everywhere as a pure structure of sovereignty and domination,
society as a whole is instead irrevocably delivered
to the form of consumer society, that is, a society
in which the sole goal of production is comfortable living.
Politics is the exhibition
ofa mediality: it is the act ofmaking a means visible as
116,7
such. Politics is the sphere neither of an end in itself nor
of means subordinated to an end; rather, it is the sphere
of a pure mediality without end intended as the field of
human action
