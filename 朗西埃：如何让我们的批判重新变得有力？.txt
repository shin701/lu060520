朗西埃：如何让我们的批判重新变得有力？
=============================

 I wanted to suggest that a true critique of the critical
tradition might have to change the very basis of the critical procedures . It might have to
endorse an opposite assumption , a foolish assumption indeed. The assumption is that the
disabled are able, that there is no hidden secret of the machine. There is no huge beast
swallowing all energies and desires in its belly, no global process of dissimulation. Instead
there is the moving landscape of distributions of capacities. In other terms , there are scenes of
dissensus . Dissensus means: there is no unity of a global process. There is not one reality and
a multiplicity of cheating appearances. There are several ways of constructing reality as a set
of givens , entailing a certain distribution of capacities. This is what political subjectivization
is about: splitting the unity of the given and the evidence of the visible, and consequently of
the possible. It is about inventing several conflicting worlds in the one and the same world.
The collective intelligence of emancipation is the collective capacity implemented in those
scenes of dissensus. It is enactment of the capacity of anyone or the capacity created by the
collectivization of the power inherent in the equality of anyone with anyone. I called it the
count of the uncounted, the part of those who have no part. It was sometimes misunderstood
as the part of the excluded. What it truly means is the power of anyone, no matter who, or the
qualification of those who no qualification. I think that the investigation of that power may
prove more fruitful to-day than the endless task of unmasking the ghosts or the endless
demonstration of the power of the beast.
