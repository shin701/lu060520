一个没有民主合法的政府只能通过发送百姓物质生活来消除对它的存在的威胁

 a regime with no democratic legitimacy can avoid threats to its existence only by offering its masses improved material well-being. That means keeping the export machine running at high speed to create jobs.There is an even greater constraint on the president’s attempts to get tough with the Chinese. Arthur Herman, the respected historian, reports that America cannot rely on China’s fear of wiping out billions in the value of their dollar assets to stop them from dumping dollars. “On an issue like Taiwan or Japan, rational judgment can take a backseat to national pride, and the desire to reverse old humiliations,” he writes in the New York Post. In a Pentagon simulation of an economic war with China held last March, China won, reports Herman.
China, which emerged fairly unscathed from the global recession, clearly considers itself to be on a roll. One (unnamed) Chinese official told the Financial Times: “We used to see the US as our teacher but now we realise that our teacher keeps making mistakes and we’ve decided to quit the class”. Market capitalism is so yesterday, state capitalism so now. A new role model for the developing world: state, authoritarian capitalism. That gives impetus to the Franco-Chinese demand that the dollar be replaced as the world’s reserve currency by a new global currency.
