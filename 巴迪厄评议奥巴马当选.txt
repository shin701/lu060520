 这不是一个政治事件，而只是一个历史事实。千万不要对奥巴马有幻想。享受象征（Enjoy the Symbolic）。不要相信国家。在政治上，只依赖自己，只依赖集体的行动。
Second, Obama’s victory is certainly a very important symbolic point of the state, of the history of the state. The development of this real from Africa — of black people, in the name of slavery, of cultural domination, of racism and poverty — is an enormous event, a strong symbol, and not only for African Americans, but also for humanity as such. 
But the symbolic level of the state is different from political truth. This strong symbol can perfectly be, at the political level, empty or even negative. The decision will be, finally, not in the hands of Obama, but in the subjective determination of the symbol. Could you accept the advice from an old philosopher, from an old country? I just can say to you, separate the levels. Don’t confuse them. Enjoy the Symbolic. Don’t trust the state. And concerning politics rely only on yourself, on the collective action.
But here we have a new operation: How can we be prepared for a political event? How can we believe in something which is really a political event and not a fact of the state of history? Generally, in those acts we live in a sort of political activity. We accept the general laws of the state as a necessity. To anticipate the creation of the new possibility, the possibility which is not the simple development of the state facts, at least at an intellectual or ideological level, we must have an idea of the possibility, a general idea of the possibility of a different possibility. We have the ideal of the formal possibility of other possibilities. And during more than one century, Communism has been the name of this ideal. And it was a great name at first. When we find this name which was the name of the possibility of something else, we have to return to the signification it had originally in two texts of Karl Marx’s. One is from 1844 — the manuscripts of 1844 — and the other is from 1848, the famous Manifesto of the Communist Party. （《“共产主义”这个字永远翻不了身了么？》）
