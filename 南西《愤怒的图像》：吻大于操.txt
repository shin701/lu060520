南西《愤怒的图像》：吻大于操
=============================

 It is about kissing, or about fucking: but precisely in so far as fucking, here, or if you will ‘sex’,
is related to the kiss, rather than the reverse. Sex becomes a metonymy of the kiss: the kiss
is broader, deeper, more encompassing than sex. We must understand that the bite of the
kiss, here, devours the sexes (their organs), not by castration, but by an absorption which
opens on to a kind of horrific sublimation: not that of sex in which a body takes pleasure,
but that of an entire body in which sex bursts out and is spattered with the body’s blood,
with its life/death and with that which explodes it: that which exposes it in splashes, drops,
streams and stains, clots and ribbons that will never again be restored to a form. We might
say that the film’s entire story is the allegory, and its entire image the literality of this: the
unbearable tearing apart of orgasm.
It is about the kiss that bites, but not a kiss unlike any other: the kiss in as much as it
bites, the kiss as power of the bite, or of death [puissance de morsure et de mort ], as
exposing/putting to death of the raw. This is why the young bride, she who remains intact
and from whom the dreadful force turns bitterly, desperately away (although we don’t
know what will happen after the end, back home), nonetheless bears the mark of the
passage from kissing to devouring, the bite mark, skin gnawed to the point of bleeding,
icon of fury.
She, intact, unpenetrated and unpleasured, is the virgin with a flower of blood on
her skin (on the surface or beneath? everything here passes through the skin), skin flushed
with blood, blossoming with an imprint that signals at once the ardour and the restraint of
her husband, carried away by her kiss yet frightened by the knowledge of his fury. She
remains intact, undecidedly intact on the edge of a return which might halt everything or
make it worse; on the point of leaving she wears leather gloves in red and white: a second,
more brilliant flower, a second skin of blood that at once protects her and exposes her for
what she is – she as much as anyone else – that is to say a body of blood (a living body is a
body of blood: blood is not simply one of its contents, it is its blood, it lives in its blood).
