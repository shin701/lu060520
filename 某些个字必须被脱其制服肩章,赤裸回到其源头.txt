某些个字必须被脱其制服肩章,赤裸回到其源头

 一个堂皇的字其实也只不过是一个普通的名词,偶尔有用,但一用,却是可做各种各样的解释的,其意义是流动的,是依赖于各种具体情境的:
As a quasi-judicial concept, the whole idea of “consultation” is broken-backed and should be discarded. Not that as human beings or human institutions we should cease to consult other interested parties about the things we propose — it is often sensible to do so. But we should remove the process from the pedestal it occupies in administrative law, abandon the attempt to decide what is or is not a “proper” consultation, divest the word of its uniform, badge and little cap, and allow it to return naked to where it came from: a common English noun, occasionally useful, but interpretable in a wide variety of ways, its meaning fluid and dependent on cirumstance.
