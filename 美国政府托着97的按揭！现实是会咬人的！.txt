 Unfortunately, memories are short. The crisis was caused in part by excessive debt: mortgages that could not be repaid; credit-card balances that consumers could not cover; property loans based on inflated values. And the solution being proposed is more debt: huge government borrowing. The economy is floating on a sea of credit, with government deficits topping $1 trillion, more than 80% of the mortgage market supported by the government, and the Federal Reserve Board printing so many dollars that fears of deflation have been replaced with a gnawing worry that inflation will prove the enemy — although not a worry of investors who are stocking up on gold and gold-related assets. Wholesale prices rose last month by an unexpectedly large 1.8% (0.5% if we exclude food and energy, of relevance to those who neither eat nor drive nor heat their homes). Worse still, the president is urging banks to lend more freely to businesses that the bankers deem unlikely to be able to repay, and government agencies are financing mortgages at 97% of the value of the homes being bought. Those loans aren’t exactly of the highest quality。
