“Flora,” from about 1516-8, by Titian.
By mastering the oil medium, Titian became the artist of choice for adorning the city’s churches and all-powerful confraternities, as well as for painting state portraits or soft-porn fantasies for private delectation.

Venetian art caught fire at the end of the 15th century with its use of oil painting. Giovanni Bellini (1431-1516) was the cusp figure. A single painting by him of the Virgin and Child with four saints, dated around 1505, opens the show. Another painting by Titian on the same theme hangs beside it, demonstrating a revolution in progress.
