 资产阶级思想:
Many people, me included, have made a conscious decision to view this recession as an opportunity to re-evaluate what is important in life and rediscover non-material values. OK, you and your husband might be cash-poor, but you are time-rich, and that’s priceless. If you could get beyond your hostility, the two of you could stay in bed on rainy Monday mornings and make out. And yes, tighter budgets rule out lavish lunches, but lengthy picnics are much more fun anyway. Instead of buying stuff you don’t need, why not sell stuff you don’t want on eBay? Expensive spas? Who needs them when you can have a bath and a massage with a Jimmyjane afterglow massage candle (www.jimmyjane.com ).
