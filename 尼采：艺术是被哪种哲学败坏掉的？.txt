  By what kind of philosophy art is corruptedBy Friedrich Nietzsche / Translated by R. J. Hollingdale

By what kind of philosophy art is corrupted.— When the mists of a metaphysical-mystical philosophy succeed in rendering all aesthetic phenomena opaque, it follows that they are also incapable of being evaluated one against another, because each of them has become inexplicable. If, however, they are never again compared with one another for the purpose of evaluation, there at last arises a completely uncritical frame of mind, a blind toleration, but likewise a steady decline in the enjoyment of art (which is distinguished from the crude appeasement of a need only by a highly acute tasting and distinguishing). The more this enjoyment declines, however, the more the desire for art is transformed back to a vulgar hunger which the artist then seeks to satisfy with ever coarser fare.
