 德勒兹要用劳伦斯来反弗罗伊德的资产阶级心理学,反他的暴力式治疗.劳伦斯的最后一部作品＜查特莱夫人的情人＞在德勒斯眼光下,可被读得很有意思.
这里的男女关系,是德勒斯的”生产”式的.
Even an organism is bourgeois: so the ideal must be mechanical. The only thing that is a unit, non-organic,composed of many different, yet equally essential parts, is the machine. Each man a machine-part, and the driving power of the machine...hate...hate of the bourgeois(上海外教社,2004:36). 
He[her writer husband] really reaped the fruits of the sensual satisfaction she got out of Mischaelis's male passivity erect inside her. But of course he never knew it, if he had, he wouldn't have said thank you(28)!
金钱打扮出来的男女关系或爱:Fellows withe swaying waists fucking little jazz girls with small boy buttocks, like two collar studs. Do you mean that sort of love? Or the joint-property, make-a-success-of -it, My-husband-my-wife sort of love?
什么是sex?
I suppose we might exchange as many sensations and emotions with women as we do ideas about the weather, and so on.Sex might be a sort of normal physical conversationbetween a man and a woman....And in the same way, unless you had some emotion or sympathy in common with a woman you wouldn't sleep with her(32).
”社会主义”是”机器”式的.
We drive ourself with a fomular, like a machine.We're all Bolshevists, only we are hypocrites. The Russians are Boshevists without hypocrisy(37).
节奏:
Your rhythm wouldn't let you(43).
虚无:
All the many busy and important little things that make up the grand sum-total of nothingness(53).
伦理学:
Be decent and simple(55).
All that rermained was a stubbon stoicism(60).
As for sex, the last of the great words, it was just a cocktail term for an excitement that bucked you up for a while, then left you more raggy than ever(60).
