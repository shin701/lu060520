巴迪厄：剧场是最地道的那类共产主义虚构
=============================

 1-Theatre is,
I will allow myself this word whose wear and tear is without cure, the very
type of communist fiction. As a temporal elucidation, it could serve as an intimate
analyzer of whatever meaning the crowd holds and as a projection of the
conflict that constitutes it. Under the fainting lights, it could be the difficult
flickering up of a public state of affairs, and better yet: the potentially
controversial distribution of matters both public and private.
But what is to be done in the meantime?
2-Here I propose my second reform, which is so wide-ranging that it is a
pleasure to see. It can be summed up as follows: our presence in the theatre halls
must become obligatory（《剧场狂想曲》）.
