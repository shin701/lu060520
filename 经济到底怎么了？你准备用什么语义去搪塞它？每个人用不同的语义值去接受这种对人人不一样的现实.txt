 到底是下滑还通胀还是衰退还是不景气，没有人说得清，经济学家们也是越来说越弄得我们糊涂：Headwinds, volatility, mortgage-related assets, CDOs, auction-rate securities, false bottom, recession. “Words, words, words,” as Eliza Doolittle screamed at Professor Higgins’s insistence （肖伯纳名剧《帕格梅莲》里的人物）on precision in their pronunciation and usage. We have been deluged with new and often confusing terms . . . and some old and confusing ones as well.
新词汇让我们迷糊。。。
