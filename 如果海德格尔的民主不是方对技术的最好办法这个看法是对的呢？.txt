如果海德格尔的民主不是方对技术的最好办法这个看法是对的呢？

 What then, if Heidegger was right in his notorious doubt about democracy:“How can
any political system be coordinated to the technological age, and which political system
would that be? I know of no answer to this question. I am not convinced that it is
democracy.”68What Heidegger had in mind as a more adequate political response to
the technological age was probably a kind of “totalitarian” sociopolitical mobilization
in the Nazi or Soviet style; he could not see how liberal-democratic “tolerance” mothe
obscene knot of ideology, and how to untie it
bilizes individuals much more effectively, turning them into workaholics—Beistegui
puts forward this obvious counterargument:
One can wonder as to whether Heidegger was right to suggest, as he did in the Der Spiegel
interview, that democracy is perhaps not the most adequate response to technology.
With the collapse of fascism and of soviet communism, the liberal model has proven to
be the most effective and powerful vehicle of the global spread of technology, which
has become increasingly indistinguishable from the forces of Capital.69
Does not the ongoing “silent revolution,” limitation of democracy, however, make the
self-evident character of this argument problematic? Does not the dynamic of today’s
global capitalism enable us to discern inherent limits to the liberal-democratic model（齐泽克《月亮视差》，374）?
