 自由教育是得到与大众文化斗争的能力。他说大众文化不是文化，文化是单义的。自由教育是对这个单义的文化的培育。这种文化是与原初说的植物的培育是一样，是不断修剪和增肥的结果。而大众文化如果也算文化，那就像是说我们做园艺是为了使院子里乱扔塑料瓶和纸一样。我们的文化萎缩光了，要我们重新开头来培育了。
然后，斯特劳斯又说，民主不是群众来统治，而是让大众文化来统治。A mass culture is a culture which can be appropriated by the meanest capacities without any intellectual and moral effort whatsoever and at a very low monetary price. But even a mass culture and precisely a mass culture requires a constant supply of what are called new ideas, which are the products of what are called creative minds: even singing commercials lose their appeal if they are not varied from time to time. But democracy, even if it is only regarded as the hard shell which protects the soft mass culture, requires in the long run qualities of an entirely different kind: qualities of dedication, of concentration, of breadth and of depth. Thus we understand most easily what liberal education means here and now. Liberal education is the counter-poison to mass culture, to the corroding effects of mass culture, to its inherent tendency to produce nothing but ”specialists without spirit or vision and voluptuaries without heart.” Liberal education is the ladder by which we try to ascend from mass democracy to democracy as originally meant. Liberal education is the necessary endeavor to found an aristocracy within democratic mass society. Liberal education reminds those members of a mass democracy who have ears to hear, of human greatness.
他说自由教育是对大众文化的ｃｏｕnter-poison，那意思是说，为了使我们对付大众文化武器更毒，我们可以将我们的这种培育故意增加毒性？使我们的思想成为毒药？
自由教育于是是我们从现在的垃圾堆一样的大众文化到达先人们原初说的文化的途径？是我们从现在的被精英和创造性的心灵制造出来的new ideas左右着的大众文化之统治之民主走向原初所说的民主的途径？自由教育是要唤醒那些已陷在群众民主里的人去领悟人的伟大。
