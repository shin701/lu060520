巴迪厄《二十世纪七重奏》：去体验真正的博爱的暴力
=============================

 Throughout the century, equality was the strategic aim: politically, under the name
of communism; scientifically, under the name of the axiomatic; artistically, under
the imperative of the fusion of art and life; sexually, as ‘mad love’. Liberty, as the
unlimited power of the negative, was presupposed, but not thematised. As for
fraternity, it was the real itself pure and simple, the sole subjective guarantee of
the novelty of experiences, since equality remained programmatic and liberty
instrumental.
I insist: fraternity is the real manifestation of the new world, and thus of the new
man. What is experimented — in the Party, in action, in the subversive artistic group,
in the egalitarian couple — is the real violence of fraternity. And what is the content
of this fraternity, if not the acceptance that the infinite ‘we’ prevails over the finitude
of the individual? This is what is named by the word ‘comrade’, which today, for
all intents and purposes, has fallen into disuse. My comrade is one who, like myself,
is only a subject by belonging to a process of truth that authorises him or her to
say ‘we’.
This is why I hold fast to the conviction that this is not in the slightest a question of
utopia or illusion. The set-up for the emergence of the subject is, quite simply,

complete. In Lacan’s terms, equality is the imaginary (since it cannot come about
as an objective figure, even though it is the ultimate reason for everything), liberty
is the symbolic (since it is the presupposed instrument, the fecund negative), and
fraternity is the real (or what is sometimes encountered, here and now).
