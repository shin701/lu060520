 齐泽克说，我们的统治者全部都在变成老贝，普京、布莱尔还有XXX。
他们搞女人？我担心的是，哪怕搞女人，他们也不肯好好地搞，非要搞出一地鸡毛来。
这是老贝的一个外围小三的境况，噢，她还是个第三世界的她者，很需要关怀的，意大利媒体记者的笔这下子用得上了：
The investigation into the prime minister's sexual activities, following suspicions that Berlusconi paid an underage Moroccan dancer, Karima El-Mahroug, thousands of euros for sex when she was 17, is deadly serious. But its ramifications took on a tragi-comic dimension when the owners of the Via Olgettina apartment complex tried to evict the models for ”lowering the tone” of the neighbourhood. That eviction notice has been shelved, but the journalists remain.
Following the police raid, García Polanco has finally put straight her belongings – a high-kitsch collection of feather boas, fake orchids, a carpet featuring the face of Marilyn Monroe and red-and-white-striped walls with the words ”Family”, ”Art” and ”Seduction” daubed on them. Next to a painting showing a scene from her native Dominican Republic, the novel Memoirs of a Geisha can be seen on her bookshelves.
However, García Polanco rejects the notion that she is a kept woman. ”I pay the  1,300 monthly rent here myself, not Berlusconi, and I never said I had sex with him,” she told the Observer, after convincing her daughter to play in her bedroom. ”The truth is that Berlusconi's dinners were just normal events followed by karaoke and Berlusconi singing in French,” she said.

不应该责怪老贝，怪也全应怪意大利全体人民；政府破产了，实际上人民更破产；莫苏里尼的法西斯政权要全国一千二百名教效忠，只有十二名拒绝而失去教职，那些效忠者战后还靠谴责法西斯来出名。
这个话不也适用于中国吗？
