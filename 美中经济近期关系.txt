美中经济近期关系
=============================

 中国从美国挣了一大笔钱，中国就指望用这堆钱来挣钱。中国想将东西卖得贵一点给美国，而美国这时想将自己的出口价钱压得低一点来增加竞争力，这样贸易不平衡就加重，美元更要贬值。
A spate of bad news followed. Factory orders down year-on-year by some 20%;
a mortgage market functioning only because the government is guaranteeing about 80% of loans written; consumer credit so tight that it is falling at the fastest rate since the crisis began two years ago, and credit increasingly unavailable to small businesses; Treasury secretary Tim Geithner forced to be economical with the truth, lest the dollar collapse, and proclaim that a strong dollar is “very important to this country”; Goldman Sachs predicting that high unemployment will drive down wages and purchasing power.
......
And that’s only in the short term. Longer term, the position of the dollar as the world’s reserve currency is under threat; America is leading the way towards growth-stifling protectionism; and economic and political power is passing from America to China, India and other emerging nations. Americans are being told to become accustomed to a sharply reduced role in the world.
Unfortunately, even if things are improving — and I prefer V for victory to W for worry — the fundamental cause of recent financial problems remains unaddressed. Low interest rates fuelled unsustainable debt. Those low rates were the result of China’s need to make money from the pile of dollars it earns from its exports. It did this by buying Treasury IOUs, keeping their price up and their rates down. China’s exports, in turn, were fuelled by its undervalued currency. That policy remains unchanged. So do trade imbalances. Which means the dollar probably has further to fall if imports to America are to become more expensive, and exports of American products more competitive.
