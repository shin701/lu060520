把内阁中的夺权搞得象学生会里的权力斗争一样，这是民主之根本；这方面看，美国民主之动作太笨重

 英国现首相Brown不受欢迎，党内想搞掉它，大报天天地讲党内正如何有人动作要搞掉它，全国人民都等着看热闹，这是很好的民主训练剧：在党内搞到足够的票，然后挑战领袖，这是政治；这样的天经地义的事儿，毛泽东为了要无条件让他自己独裁专制居然认为这是在党内搞不团结：其实可以在全国人民众目睽睽下搞这种夺权的，很正当，有什么了不起：
POWERFUL cabinet ministers who see themselves as potential successors to Gordon Brown are secretly plotting against him despite public protestations of loyalty.
Even as Brown met yesterday at No 10 with Barack Obama, the visiting US Democratic presidential candidate, the prime minister was an increasingly isolated figure whose days in office are now being measured in weeks.
Senior MPs are running a campaign on behalf of Jack Straw, the justice secretary, to collect names for a possible leadership bid.
A backbencher has told how he had been approached by George Howarth, the former Home Office minister and a friend of Straw.
  “George told me he was collecting names for Jack,” said the MP. “He said Jack was ready to tell Gordon the game was up, if there was enough support.”
Other MPs have revealed how a “Lancashire mafia” of members allied to Straw, who represents Blackburn, have met colleagues in the Commons tea room to ask if they would support him as a “save the party” leader. They have also been calling colleagues to prepare the ground for a possible autumn coup.
