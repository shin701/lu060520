 烤的时候，火炉必须吹蒸汽到面团上：In France, the ovens are designed to inject steam into the bread to produce the chewy crust. Patience is another key ingredient that is often lost in the UK.；否则lets the dough rest for at least three hours and sprinkles water on it to get round a lack of steaming facilities.
终极目标是：A lovely authentic pain de campagne, “Very good, very crusty,
面粉必须来自法国：Flour from French wheat varieties is crucial if you want an authentic taste。
面团要“醒”prove二小时an authentic recipe that allows the dough to prove for two hours 。
不好的面包：太拧rubbery and tasteless
bendy with an inferior crust”.
好的面包：A good crust, a crisp and crunchy texture, and aroma,”
可以象油条烧饼那样拿了边走边吃的感觉：a warm baguette in any corner boulangerie in France, break off the crust and munch it in ecstasy in the street.
这样看来，法国面包的难寻，就在于资本主义生产方式破坏我们日常生活。穷地方，吃到热的和脆的东西，总更容易，经济的规律。
