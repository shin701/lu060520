 一起谋杀案的原因经公诉人的嘴转述被告的陈述：In April 1999 Mrs Hale told her husband that she was seeking a divorce and he said that he would contest the case. Mr Hale wrote: “Now Mo says she doesn't love me, but she would like to keep the ￡300,000 house, all the children and an income to keep her and the children in the style to which she has become accustomed, ie, nice car, money, no job, friends to visit and have coffee with.”
它是由这样一些日常词汇编织而成，我们在算计着过这样的生存时，实际是通过这些基本词汇来作代数运算的：to keep the ￡300,000 house, all the children and an income to keep her and the children in the style to which she has become accustomed, ie, nice car, money, no job, friends to visit and have coffee with.
