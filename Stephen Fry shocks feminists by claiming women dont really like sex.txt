Stephen Fry shocks feminists by claiming women don't really like sex

 In uncharacteristically extreme comments, the openly gay Twitter champion said he believed most straight men felt that ”they disgust women” as they ”find it difficult to believe that women are as interested in sex as they are”.
”For good reason,” he declares in a candid interview in the November issue of Attitude magazine. ”If women liked sex as much as men, there would be straight cruising areas in the way there are gay cruising areas. Women would go and hang around in churchyards thinking: 'God, I've got to get my fucking rocks off', or they'd go to Hampstead Heath and meet strangers to shag behind a bush. It doesn't happen. Why? Because the only women you can have sex with like that wish to be paid for it.”
Fry, 53, continues: ”I feel sorry for straight men. The only reason women will have sex with them is that sex is the price they are willing to pay for a relationship with a man, which is what they want,” he said. ”Of course, a lot of women will deny this and say, 'Oh no, but I love sex, I love it!' But do they go around having it the way that gay men do?”
The remarks denote a marked break in tone from a man whose public shtick tends towards inoffensive charm and gently upmarket wit and are likely to be roundly dismissed by those who have embraced the idea of women's ability to have unemotional, uncommitted sex as an empowered lifestyle choice.
