 But if this is true, if the caesura between the human and ~he
animal passes first of all within man, then it is the ~ery questlon
of man-and of ”humanism”-that must be posed III a new way.
In our culture, man has always been thought of as the articulation
and conjunction of a body and a soul, of a living thing and a .logos,
of a natural (or animal) element and a supernatural or SOCial or
divine element. We must learn instead to think of man as what
results from the incongruity of these twO elements, and investigate
not the metaphysical mystery of conjunction, but rather t~e pra~tical
and political mystery of separation. What is man, If he IS
always the place-and, at the same time, the result-of cease~e~s
divisions and caesurae? It is more urgent to work on these dlvI-
. ns to ask in what way-within man-has man been separated
SIO , h ., ak
from non-man, and the animal from the human, t an It IS to t e
positions on the great issues, on so-called human rights and .val-
And P
erhaps even the most luminous sphere of our relatlons
ues. h' h
with the divine depends, in some way, on that darker one w IC
separates us from the animal.（《开放的人与动物》，16）
