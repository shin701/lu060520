把男人弄过了高潮,她就可以从容地高潮,女人永远有这先机在手,劳伦斯说

 For of course, being a girl, one's whole dignity and meaning in life consisted in the achievement of an absolute, a perfect, a pure and noble freedom...To shake off the oldand sordid connexions and subjections....The beautiful pure freedom of a woman was infinitely more wonderful than any sexual love...Rather she could use the sex thing to to have power over him. For she only had to hold herself back in intercoourse, and let him finish and spend himself without herself coming to the crisis:and then she could prolong the connexion and achieve her orgasm and her crisis while he was merely her tool(＜查＞, 4) 
反过说,你必须给女人这一绝对的将自己当作礼物给出的自由,爱才会甜蜜?男人象狗一样盯着SEX, 象孩子一样地无助于自己对女人的胃口.女人只要给出男人想要的东西,就够.这个任务对女人来说太简单,太被贬低.
所以,
