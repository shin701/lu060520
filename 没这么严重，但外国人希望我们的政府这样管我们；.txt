 但英国的教育部还要求所有十六岁以下儿童和少年足球赛不须用比分来分胜负呢？英足总要求父母不能在赛后谈比分，因为，它认为，老谈比分，所以英国人足球技术越来越粗糙了，应象西班牙儿童那样为玩而玩。
为奥运，政府精神文明办要求北京百姓这不做那一定要做，这是夸大了，但外国读者最爱看这样写，这有什么办法？
If the men of Beijing think they can still emerge from their homes of a morning — unshaven, a bit smelly, still in their pyjamas and slippers — and saunter down to the supermarket or the public lavatories, they can think again: the etiquette police are in town and it is time to spruce up for the Olympics.
Even clothes that Chinese citizens of both sexes would consider smart may not be good enough: white socks worn with black shoes are out, leather skirts are frowned upon, bright nail varnish is a no and woe betide anyone whose colours clash.
Beijing’s 15 million residents have been given their sartorial and social instructions from the Capital Spiritual Civilisation Construction Commission, which has ruled on everything from what (and what not) to wear, how to shake hands and the etiquette of smoking and queueing. With the eyes of the world on Beijing, its residents will not be allowed to put a foot wrong or show a hair out of place.
