 现在欠8千亿，到2013-2014年度所欠会占到国民总产值的80%，这样挣扎着掉进漩涡要到2032年才能回到今年的欠债水平！现在这水平，三块钱里有一块是只好上国家来花，这么多债一个的成本是257。1亿！
 The most succinct statistic is also the scariest: by the 2013-14 financial year, government spending on welfare and on servicing the national debt will total ￡257.1 billion. How much does that amount to exactly? Just over ￡1 in every ￡3 that will be spent by the Government.
    National debt, according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, stands at ￡804.8 billion; or just over ￡25,000 for each family in the country. The sum grew by ￡16.1 billion last month alone, which means that the Government is sinking deeper into debt at a rate of ￡6,017 a second; or ￡520 million a day.
 The Treasury expects debt interest payments to balloon by 11.1 per cent a year. It expects social security costs to rise by 1.4 per cent a year.
 So every day the Government has to find ￡83.6 million to pay interest on what it already owes. That’s ￡1.37 a day for everyone in the country.
 The figures show that interest payments on the national debt are expected to swell from the current financial year’s total of ￡27.2 billion to ￡63.7 billion in 2013-14. To put this in some kind of context, this is more than Britain will spend on defence and transport combined this year.
 As for spending on social security, that is due to rise from ￡165.6 billion this year to an alarming ￡193.4 billion in 2013-14 — and by a total of ￡63.6 billion during the period.
 The Institute for Fiscal Studies forecasts that debt — which has hovered around 40 per cent of national income — will rise to around 80 per cent of national income by 2013-14 and the ratio will not return to its current levels until around 2032.
