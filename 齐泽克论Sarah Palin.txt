 Earlier generations of women politicians (Golda Meir, Indira Gandhi, Margaret Thatcher, up to a point even Hillary Clinton) were what is usually referred to as ”phallic” women: they acted as ”iron ladies” who imitated and tried to outdo male authority, to be ”more men than men themselves.”  ...Jacques-Alain Miller pointed out how Sarah Palin, on the contrary, proudly displays her femininity and motherhood.  She has a ”castrating” effect on her male opponents not by way of being more manly than them, but by using the ultimate feminine weapon, the sarcastic put-down of male authority -- she knows that male ”phallic” authority is a posture, a semblance to be exploited and mocked.  Recall how she mocked Obama as a ”community organizer,” exploiting the fact that there was something sterile in Obama's physical appearance, with his diluted black skin, slender features, and big ears.  Here we have ”post-feminist” femininity without a complex, uniting the features of mother, prim teacher (glasses, hair in a bun), public person, and, implicitly, sex object, proudly displaying the ”first dude” as a phallic toy.  The message is that she ”has it all” -- and that, to add insult to injury, it was a Republican woman who had realized this Left-liberal dream...No wonder that the Palin effect is one of false liberation: drill, baby, drill（很色的台词！！）!
