德普雷：《革命中的革命》
=============================

 Seeing Easy Rider or Mourir à Madrid
(To Die in Madrid) or Citizen Kane can change a kid's life. But 320 different types of cheese or
wine won't, however much the studio bosses suggest that America makes movies and France
sticks to gastronomy.
Political dominance always means that you kill off other ways of seeing things. By
transforming three-quarters of the world into a cultural proletariat, you will make people of
this class into more determined rebels in the 21st century. Far more determined, in fact, than
the economic proletariat has been in the 20th century.
四分之三的人都成了无产阶级，革命是否容易一些了？
突尼斯是否会成为一种格式？政府将被草台班子般地被掀掉。黑压压的人群越挤越多，最后是成了90%的人来反对0.1%的人了。
