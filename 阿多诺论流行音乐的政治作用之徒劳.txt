英文意思是这样:
What he is saying is that trying to express political process through the means of pop music (entertainment music) is ridiculous (and futile?). The reason for this is that pop music is so closely knit to the cultural industry which is only concerned with amusement and consumption. Finally he says: ”When ever someone says that they have to sing because they can`t stand the Vietnam war, well then I have to admit I can`t stand their singing.”  I believe, in fact, that attempts to bring political protest together with ”popular music” -- that is, with entertainment music -- are for the following reason doomed from the start. The entire sphere of popular music, even there where it dresses itself up in modernist guise is to such a degree inseparable from the Warencharakter, from consumption, from the cross-eyed transfixion with amusement, that --er-- attempts to outfit it with a new function remain entirely superficial...  And I have to say that when somebody sets himself up, and for whatever reason [accompanies] maudlin music by singing something or other about Viet Nam being unbearable. . .I find that, in fact, THIS SONG is in fact unbearable, in that by taking the horrendous and making it somehow consumable, it ends up wringing something like consumption-qualities out of it.
