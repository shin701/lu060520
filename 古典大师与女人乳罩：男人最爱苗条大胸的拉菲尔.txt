WHEN everything goes pear-shaped on a woman, she may not feel as pretty as a picture. 
With some marketing magic, however, she can see herself as a Botticelli and her apple-shaped girlfriend a Rubens, rather than a Granny Smith.
Lingerie-maker Triumph says women are tired of being compared to fruit and has taken a more romantic look at body shape, with Rembrandt, Matisse, da Vinci and Raphael the other classifications.
The labels are loosely based on the shapes of females who appeared in paintings by the various artists.
A Rembrandt, according to Triumph, has a smaller waist and fuller bust and bottom.
A da Vinci is straight and a Matisse has narrow shoulders and hips, a wider midriff and weight in the upper legs.
Triumph surveyed more than 1500 people and found men preferred the slender but larger-busted Raphael.
While 35 per cent of men preferred the Raphael, only 7 per cent of women classified themselves as that shape.
Similarly, 29 per cent of men found the Rembrandt appealing but only 14 per cent of women identified with it. Least popular with men (4 per cent) was the Rubens, the shape which 26 per cent of women identified with.
Adelaide Central School of Art head of drawing Rob Gutteridge said the female form lost something in translation from impressionism to commercialism.
”They may be stretching some of the differences just to use the name,” Mr Gutteridge said yesterday. ”If it's for advertising, they'll take licence.”
The Triumph survey also examined men's and women's opinions on showing off the female body.
More than half of women (62 per cent) believe it is never acceptable to show cleavage at work. Only 30 per cent of men say it is never acceptable.
