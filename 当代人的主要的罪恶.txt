 当代教皇的个人雇佣神学家对我们时代的男女的主要罪恶的列举和排行：The seven deadly sins are: lust, gluttony, avarice, sloth, anger, envy and pride (as opposed to chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility). Last year, however, the Vatican suggested these might be supplemented with some new sins particularly relevant to the modern age — namely genetic modification, human experimentation, polluting the environment, social injustice, causing poverty, financial gluttony and the taking or selling of drugs (I’m not really seeing how smoking a doobie offends the Lord in a way comparable to deliberately causing poverty, but anyway . . . ).
According to Busa and Giertych’s Vatican-endorsed findings, if you’re a man, then your number one sin is lust, followed by gluttony — and then sloth, since by that point you’re probably too sated, in both senses, to move.
If you’re a woman, the prime sin is pride, followed by envy and then anger, which, I must say, doesn’t paint a very attractive picture. No wonder men sit around eating a lot and watching porn.
一个当代专栏作家自己的非神学家式看法：In fact, the list provides a useful insight into the fundamental differences between the sexes today: men eat and shag and then worry about it; women preen and resent, with a little envy and crossness chucked in, and don’t especially like themselves for it either. The “vice divide” identified by the Vatican echoes the societal changes of the past few decades in an unexpectedly modern way — and what initially seems like an entertaining little titbit provides a perfect snapshot of male and female unease.
