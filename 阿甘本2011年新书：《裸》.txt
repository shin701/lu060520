 20. At the end of the 1920S and the beginning of the 1930S Benjamin
associated with a group of very attractive female friends.
Among them were Gert Wissing, Ola Parem, and Eva Hermann,
whom he thought all shared the same special relationship to appearance.
In the diaries he kept during his stay on the French Riviera
between May and June of r93r, Benjamin sought ro describe
this relationship, linking it with the theme of appearance that he
had confronted some years before in his essay on Goethe's novel.
”Speyer's wife,” he writes,
reported this astounding statement by Eva Hermann, from the period
of her greatest depression: ”The fact that I am unhappy doesn't mean
that I have to run around with a face full of wrinkles.” This made many
things clear to me, above all that the rudimentary contact that I have
had in recent years with these creatures-Gert, Eva Hermann, and so
on-is only a feeble and belated echo of one of the most fundamental
experiences of my life: the experience of appearance [Schein] . I spoke
yesterday with Speyer about this, who for his part also contemplated
about these women and made the curious observation that they have
no sense of honor, or rather that their code of honor is actually to say
everything they think. This is a very true observation, and it proves
the profundity of the obligation they feel toward appearance. For this
”saying everything” is meant above all to destroy what has been said; or
rather, once it has been destroyed, to turn it into an object. Only insofar
as it is apparent [scheinhtifi] arc they able to assimilate itY
One could define this attitude as the ”nihilism of beauty,” common
to many beautiful women, which consists in reducing one's
own beauty to pute appearance and then exhibiting this appearance
with a sort of remote sadness, stubbornly denying the idea
that beauty can signifY something other than itself. But it is precisely
the very lack of illusions about itself-this nudity without
veils that beauty thus manages to achieve-that furnishes the most
frightful attraction, This disenchantment of beauty, this special nihilism,
reaches its extreme stage with the mannequins or the fashion
models, who learn before all else to erase all expression from
their faces. In so doing, their faces become pure exhibition value
and, as a result, acquire a particular allure（Nudity， 2011：87-88）.
