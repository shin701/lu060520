齐泽克：重复列宁
=============================

 “Lenin” is not the nostalgic name for old dogmatic certainty;
quite on the contrary, to put it in Kierkegaard’s terms, THE
Lenin which we want to retrieve is the Lenin-in-becoming, the
Lenin whose fundamental experience was that of being thrown
into a catastrophic new constellation in which old coordinates
proved useless, and who was thus compelled to REINVENT
Marxism — recall his acerbic remark apropos of some new
problem: “About this, Marx and Engels said not a word.” The
idea is not to return to Lenin, but to REPEAT him in the
Kierkegaardian sense: to retrieve the same impulse in today’s
constellation. The return to Lenin aims neither at nostalgically
reenacting the “good old revolutionary times,” nor at the
opportunistic-pragmatic adjustment of the old program to “new
conditions,” but at repeating, in the present world-wide
conditions, the Leninist gesture of reinventing the revolutionary
project in the conditions of imperialism and colonialism, more
precisely: after the politico-ideological collapse of the long era
of progressism in the catastrophe of 1914. Eric Hobsbawn
defined the CONCEPT of the XXth century as the time between
1914, the end of the long peaceful expansion of capitalism, and
1990, the emergence of the new form of global capitalism after
the collapse of the Really Existing Socialism. What Lenin did
for 1914, we should do for 1990. “Lenin” stands for the
compelling FREEDOM to suspend the stale existing
(post)ideological coordinates, the debilitating Denkverbot in
which we live — it simply means that we are allowed to think
again.
