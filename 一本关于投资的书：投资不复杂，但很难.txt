 投资不复杂，但很难。厉害的经理也发现要长远地战胜市场，是不可能的。
People outside the profession think investment is complicated. Generally speaking it is not. On the other hand, though not complicated, investment is difficult. Professional managers find it hard to beat the market in the long term.”
与齐美尔说的一样，投资需要一种隔离感，也就是人要善于对甩出去的东西也就是钱表示不大在乎，给出和得到时应比一般人更看开一点儿，好象不着自己的利害一样：Successful investors need a particular detachment, even from their own egos.
正是错误使我们比别人多那么一点优势来胜出：Mistakes are the things that make one fractionally better at investment, at least as much as successes and any manager who only has successes to talk about is a charlatan or a novice. Howlers, anyway, are much more interesting.”
投资是抽象的。一开始是一张纸，你要相信了当真去执行，中间是肉身参与，身体力行：Investment involves the fluctuating ownership from a sedentary position of what were once pieces of paper and have now been virtualised so that they are no more than entries in some faceless computer records. It is an activity which can seem unreal.”
投资仍是那个苏格拉底问题的一个侧面：“Know thyself。
如果有什么事看上去好得象不可能，那一定就是不可能不真实的，千万不要卷到里面去！做什么事都应取这一态度：“If something looks too good to be true, it probably is. That is not original, but it is true of investment, of politics, certainly of journalism, and of life itself.
