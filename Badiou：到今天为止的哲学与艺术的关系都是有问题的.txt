Badiou：到今天为止的哲学与艺术的关系都是有问题的
=============================

 This question is of the greatest importance to us. From the vast quantity of references which the Affirmationists of the future will assemble and publish, let me isolate narcissistically one of my own texts. In the first chapter of Petit manuel d’inesthétique, I propose the distinction, in regard to the relationship between art and philosophy, between three essential systems. The first, which I call “Didactic,” claims, in a Platonic or Stalinist manner, to submit artistic activity to the external imperative of the Idea. The second, “Classical,” puts art under the natural rule of pleasing forms and confers upon it, in the manner of Aristotle or Louis XIV, the practical virtue of temperance of passion rather than a mission of truth. The third, the “Romantic,” on the contrary, sees in art the only free form of descent of the infinite Idea into the sensory, and asks thus that philosophy bow down before art, in the manner of Heidegger and of certain fascisms.
