你总不能说，成千上万的知识分子会依附于一个如此颠三倒四、如此虚幻的一种历史，仿佛千万人都在犯同样一个错误，而它可以顷刻就被改正，使人人因此羞愧难当，人人都觉得自己在革命和文革中的发傻和犯傻。难道你真的会相信如此的？
Already, in 1991, Jean-Luc Nancy spoke about the anger one is overwhelmed with when hearing all this empty talk about ‘the end of communism’.17 The belief that history is now finally finished with Marxism and communism, and simply so, he found ridiculous:
As if history, our history, could be so inconsistent, so phantasmic, so flaky [floconneuse] to have carried us along for one hundred and fifty years on clouds that dissipate in a moment. As if error, pure, simple, and stupid error could be thus corrected, regulated, mobilized. As if thousands of so-called ‘intellectuals’ were simply fools, and especially as if millions of others were even more stupid as to have been caught in the delirium of the first.18
It is not so much the suppression of communism as a historical fact, the erasure of the communist past with all its intellectual and political complexity from the historical consciousness of postcommunism, that evokes Nancy’s indignation and concern, but rather the immense ignorance with which the postcommunist world refuses to wonder about this past and its afterlife, or to ask: ‘Why did this all happen?’ Nancy sees in this the true, almost epochal stupidity of the postcommunist turn.
