德里达：什么是左派和右派？
=============================

 I would say that the left, for me, that in which I resolutely wish to recognise myself, situates itself on the side where one analyses the troubling and new logic of these equivocations today and tries to effectively change their structure; and along with them the very structure of politics, the reproduction of discursive political tradition. I propose a minimal axiom: on the left there is the desire to affirm what is to come, to change, and to do so in the sense of the greatest possible justice. I would not say that everyone on the right is insensitive to change and to justice (that would be unjust), but it never makes justice the first resort or axiom of its action. To take up distinctions that are not outdated, despite a fundamental transformation of the very concept of labour: the left will always privilege the profit from 'labour' over that from 'capital'. The right always alleges that the latter is the condition of the former. To be 'on the right' consists in being conservative, but of what? Over and above certain interests, powers, riches, capitals, social norms and 'ideologies' and so forth, over and above politics, the right always tends to preserve a certain traditional structure of the political itself, of the relations between civil society, nation and state. If one upholds the opposition of left and right, it is surely not easy to be on the left with some consequence, to be always on the left - a difficult strategy.
