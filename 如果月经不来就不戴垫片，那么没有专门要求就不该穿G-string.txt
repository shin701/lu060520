如果月经不来就不戴垫片，那么没有专门要求就不该穿G-string

I没有时尚，只有语言的法西斯；没有革命，只有欲望的泛滥，巴尔特说；看到女人这样写文章，让我想到我们本来会生活在一个什么要的世界里：女人保守起来和开放起来都一样地失控。是什么是使下面这个作者小小年纪就学到了如此腔调？
Look, I am no G-string fascist (and considering the image my mind conjures up of a ”G-string fascist” is that of Michelle ”Bombshell” McGee – Jesse James's former mistress, whose hobbies included sporting Nazi paraphernalia and posing for allegedly erotic photos, often at the same time – I'm now 200% sure I'm not one.) I don't understand how on earth anal dental floss became the de rigeur sexy outfit when to my mind it is about as sexy as a colostomy bag. And as with a colostomy bag, it is there to serve a purpose, namely, to prevent VPL. This is why people who wear G-strings when there is no need – such as when they're wearing jeans, for example, or, heaven help us all, as a bikini on the beach – are clearly clinically insane and should be bundled off immediately, for the sake of not just everyone else but their own rectums. If you don't use a tampon when you don't have your period, don't wear a G-string if it is not required. And if you do wear a tampon during other weeks of the month, seek help.
