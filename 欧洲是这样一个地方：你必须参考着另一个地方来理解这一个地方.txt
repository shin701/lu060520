 走很多地方和读很多书。列宁能不小心弄得情妇和太太在同一条火车上，而不紧张，还关心别的事儿。。。
A certain way of being European has triumphed, and the continent is the better for it; the alternatives are both horrible and still easily available. But history as grand narrative is a sealed train. The real life of cities, peoples and continents resists being captured in a single storyline, no matter how moral its conclusion. In the end, the real Europe may be no more than the routes marked out on Mak’s maps: the connections, both hopeful and tragic, that make understanding one place impossible without reference to another. There is no Moscow, Mak suggests, without Stalingrad, no Bonn without Dresden, no Amsterdam without Auschwitz.
