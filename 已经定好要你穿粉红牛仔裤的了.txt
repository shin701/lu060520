Trendwatchers believe this loud-trousered look is unlikely to fade. The consensus among fashion insiders was that the look is too useful to peter out. ”I wear red ones as part of my work uniform with heels and a blazer,” said Curren. Nathalie Hartley, senior fashion editor at Instyle, said bright jeans can be worn for both work and pleasure. ”They can be rock'n'roll but they can look professional too. I saw a woman in her 40s wearing raspberry jeans, a twinset and stilettos in rush hour this morning. It was proof that bright jeans can look upstate.”
